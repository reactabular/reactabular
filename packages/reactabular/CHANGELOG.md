5.3.0 / ?
==================

## reactabular-search

  * `search.multipleColumns` and `search.singleColumn` now accept a `castingStrategy` parameter to define how to cast properties when searching. By default, everything buy arrays is casted to a string.
  * `search.matches` now traverses arrays and returns results in the same shape.

5.2.1 / 2016-09-30
==================

## reactabular-tree

  * Bug fix - If `className` is not provided to `tree.toggleChildren`, do not render `undefined` as a class. Also dropped extra `console.log`.

5.2.0 / 2016-09-30
==================

## reactabular-tree

  * Bug fix - Calculate `tree.getParents` correctly for root level nodes without parents. Previously that gave false positives.
  * Feature - Annotate `tree.toggleChildren` with `has-children` and `has-parent` classes. Easier to style this way.

5.1.0 / 2016-09-29
==================

## reactabular-tree

  * Feature - Add `tree.flatten` to allow transforming a nested tree structure into a flat structure used by the algorithms.

5.0.2 / 2016-09-28
==================

## reactabular-virtualized

  * Bug fix - Skip `setState` on `componentWillReceiveProps` if no rows were calculated. #209

5.0.1 / 2016-09-28
==================

## reactabular-easy

  * Bug fix - If there are no draggable headers, do *not* inject `dnd.Header`. This means you don't need to set up React DnD if you aren't using drag and drop functionality. #209

5.0.0 / 2016-09-28
==================

## reactabular-easy

  * Breaking - Push children toggle behavior to `onToggleShowingChildren` prop. See the readme for a sample implementation. This makes the implementation more flexible. You can trigger `reactabular-tree` `collapseAll` and `expandAll` over `showingChildren` for instance.

4.3.0 / 2016-09-27
==================

## reactabular-tree

  * Improvement - Let `toggleChildren` toggle when cell is clicked. If you want the old behavior, override `onClick` through `props`.
  * Improvement - Add `collapseAll` and `expandAll` helpers.

4.2.0 / 2016-09-23
==================

## reactabular-easy

  * Improvement - Accept `toggleChildrenProps` for customization.

## reactabular-tree

  * Improvement - Allow `toggleChildren` to accept `props` for customization.

4.1.0 / 2016-09-20
==================

## react-edit

  * Improvement - Pass `extraParameters` to `edit` interface. #201

## reactabular-sort

  * Improvement - Add `sort.byColumnsPrioritizeLastSorted`. #199

4.0.0 / 2016-09-12
==================

## reactabular-easy

  * Breaking - Push `onDragColumn` control to user. Earlier it managed widths through CSS (more performant, but also more brittle). The problem with that was that the initial update of a stylesheet could fail (no widths were set). Now widths are controlled by React completely. Note that the API changed to `onDragColumn(width, { columnIndex })`.

3.0.6 / 2016-09-12
==================

## reactabular-table

  * Improvement - Allow `BodyRow` `shouldComponentUpdate` to be overridden by setting `components.body.row.shouldComponentUpdate = true`.

## reactabular-virtualized

  * Bug fix - Rework initial measurement so that it works with CSS solutions like Radium.

3.0.5 / 2016-09-02
==================

## reactabular-tree

  * Improvement - Allow `id` to be passed to `filter`.

## reactabular-easy

  * Bug fix - Pass `rowKey` to `tree.filter`. This way it filters correctly with arbitrary ids.

3.0.4 / 2016-09-02
==================

## reactabular-tree

  * Improvement - Allow `toggleChildren` `id` to be customized (not just "id" anymore).

## reactabular-easy

  * Bug fix - Pass `rowKey` to `tree.toggleChildren`. This way toggling can work with arbitrary ids.

3.0.3 / 2016-09-01
==================

## reactabular-easy

  * Bug fix - Drop redundant `console.log`.

3.0.2 / 2016-09-01
==================

## reactabular-virtualized

  * Improvement - Push development logging behind `window.LOG_VIRTUALIZED`.

## reactabular-tree

  * Improvement - Include suggested default styling for the toggle arrow.

3.0.1 / 2016-09-01
==================

## reactabular-virtualized

  * Bug fix - Keep header and body in sync when scrolling at header.

## reactabular-tree

  * Bug fix - Pass `strategy` to `sorter` at `tree.sort`.

3.0.0 / 2016-09-01
==================

## reactabular-virtualized

  * Improvement - New standalone package. Virtualization provides a nice performance increase for large datasets. The package works in tandem with reactabular-sticky.

## reactabular-table

  * Breaking - `onRow` accepts `row, { rowIndex, rowKey }` instead of `row, rowIndex`.
  * Improvement - If a row contains `_index`, use that as a `rowIndex`. This allows custom indexing (useful for virtualization).

## reactabular-easy

  * Improvement - Integrate virtualization for extra performance.
  * Improvement - Integrate `reactabular-tree`. Now it works with tree style data. You should set `cell.toggleChildren: true` to show the UI control for toggling row children visibility.

## reactabular-resizable

  * Improvement - Expose `parent` prop (defaults to `document`). This is handy if you use an iframe and need something more custom.

## reactabular-tree

  * Breaking - Rewrite API. Now most parts accept objects and you can also customize field names.
  * Improvement - Add `tree.sort` to wrap toggling row children.

## reactabular-sticky

  * Bug fix - Make sure `scrollOffset` gets a value no matter what. This avoid a React warning.

## reactabular-utils

  * Add `resolveRowKey`.

2.0.5 / 2016-08-26
==================

## reactabular-sort

  * Bug fix - Make sure `sort.byColumns` does not mutate passed `sortingColumns`. Now it performs a deep clone using lodash.

## reactabular-sticky

  * Improvement - Allow `onScroll` handler to be defined for `Body`. Previously it overrode that.

## reactabular-table

  * Improvement - Allow `Body` `rowKey` to be defined as a function (`({ rowData, rowIndex }) => {... return a rowKey ...}`). #193

2.0.4 / 2016-08-24
==================

## reactabular-sticky

  * Bug fix - Calculate extra padding to table body so that header and body widths match even if a scrollbar is visible.

2.0.3 / 2016-08-22
==================

## reactabular-easy

  * Improvement - If an empty column definition is provided, escape early and avoid showing a warning per row.

2.0.2 / 2016-08-17
==================

## react-edit

  * Improvement - Allow value rendering to be customized. Now you can pass a custom renderer for value if the default (no visible value!) isn't enough.

## reactabular-resolve

  * Bug fix - Make sure `resolve` does not crash if `rows` aren't provided. It will return an empty array in that case.

2.0.1 / 2016-08-16
==================

  * Improvement - Generate a proper ES6 build for each package. This time it transpiles ES6 features too unlike before. The problem was that Babel didn't transpile object rest spread within ES6 classes correctly. This means ES6 -> ES5 transformation needs to be performed. Not ideal, but this works.

2.0.0 / 2016-08-16
==================

  * Breaking - Push `property` to root level of a column over cell. The new style is often terser.
  * Improvement - Generate a proper ES6 build for each package. Now they should work with systems like webpack 2 without problems. #189

## react-edit

  * Breaking - Rename as `react-edit` given it's a generic component. It's not distributed as a part of `reactabular` anymore and you'll have to install it separately. #176.
  * Breaking - Auto focus `input` by default. #180.

## reactabular-table

  * Improvement - Improve performance by pushing `onRow` check lower in the component hierarchy.

## reactabular-search-field

  * Breaking - Override `query` `onChange` instead of patching.
  * Breaking - Make it possible to pass `column` as a prop. You should manage its state now. #182
  * Improvement - Add `onColumnChange` hook. This is needed for tracking `column` state.
  * Bug fix - Make search input controlled by default.

## reactabular-sort

  * Breaking - Return sorting columns if no selected column is passed.
  * Breaking - Extract header styling to a separate file (`style.css` at package root) and allow `style` prop to be passed.
  * Breaking - Port sorting to a property based scheme over index one.
  * Improvement - Mark React as a peer dependency.
  * Improvement - Allow sorting `fieldName` to be customized for `sort`, `header`, and `reset`. This is useful if you want to sort per `property` for example.
  * Improvement - Allow `sorter` `getColumns` mechanism to be customized. This is needed to make `fieldName` useful.

## reactabular-resizable

  * Breaking - Extract header styling to a separate file (`style.css` at package root) and allow `style` prop to be passed.
  * Improvement - Document how to offset the widget.

## reactabular-easy

  * Breaking - Push `sortingColumns` to a prop. You should control its state yourself.
  * Improvement - Add suggested default styling (`style.css` at package root).
  * Improvement - Allow `classNames` and `styles` props to be passed for styling.
  * Bug fix - Force update after mounting. This is needed for the sticky ref scheme to work.

## reactabular-resolve

  * Breaking - Rework `resolve` interface to be object based and pass row index through it.
  * Improvement - Implement `resolve.index`. This attached the row indices to `_index`. That can be handy data to have for optimization.

## reactabular-visibility-toggles

  * Improvement - New standalone package of its own. #183

## reactabular-dnd

  * Improvement - New standalone package of its own for wrapping drag and drop related concerns.

## reactabular-tree

  * Improvement - New standalone package of its own for tree helpers. #168

1.2.6 / 2016-08-11
==================

  * Improvement - select - Drop direct dependency on Reactabular.
  * Improvement - easy - Expose `components`. Now you can override default components just like for a regular `Table.Provider`. Only exception is `header.cell` given drag and drop needs to override that in order to work.
  * Improvement - easy - Make `selectedRowIdField` prop optional. It worked before due to the default value, but it's neater this way.

1.2.5 / 2016-08-08
==================

  * Improvement - search-field - Accept `query` as a prop now. Better for persistency.

1.2.4 / 2016-08-08
==================

  * Improvement - search-columns - Rewrite as a stateless function. You should pass `query` as a prop now.

1.2.3 / 2016-08-08
==================

  * Improvement - reactabular - New `search-columns` module for searching per column (UI).
  * Improvement - reactabular - New `search-field` module for searching (UI).
  * Improvement - table - Make `rowKey` propType check compatible with React 15.3. It should give you better output during development now.
  * Improvement - easy - Expose `headerExtra` prop. It can be used to inject extra rows to a header. This works well with `reactabular-search-columns`.
  * Improvement - easy - Expose `onSort` and `sortingColumns` props. These are useful for implementing sorting persistency.

1.2.2 / 2016-08-07
==================

  * Bug fix - resizable - Fix README example as Sticky API has been simplified (no need for ReactDOM anymore).

1.2.1 / 2016-08-05
==================

  * Improvement - edit - Expose `event` to `onActivate`.
  * Improvement - easy - Push `reactabular` and `reactabular-utils` as peer dependencies. This way you have better control over which versions to consume at your project.

1.2.0 / 2016-08-05
==================

  * Bug fix - table - Pass unresolved values to `Table.Body` transforms instead of resolved ones.

1.1.6 / 2016-08-05
==================

  * Improvement - edit - Allow `activateEvent` (default `onClick`) to be overridden.
  * Improvement - easy - Trigger `onMoveColumns` only after moving columns has finished.
  * Improvement - easy - Expose `selectedRowId`. It defaults to `id`, but if your selection logic relies on some other field, you can change it now.
  * Improvement - reactabular - New `select` module for handling row selections.

1.1.5 / 2016-08-04
==================

  * Improvement - Attach `NODE_ENV` checks to `propTypes`. Smaller size for production usage.

1.1.4 / 2016-08-04
==================

  * Bug fix - sort - Do not crash if column `cell` definition is missing. #178

1.1.3 / 2016-08-04
==================

  * Bug fix - easy - If a header is set both `sortable` and `resizable`, allow custom formatter to used still.

1.1.2 / 2016-08-04
==================

  * Bug fix - sticky - Fix `reactabular-table` import. Missing `* as`.

1.1.1 / 2016-08-04
==================

  * Bug fix - sticky - Fix `reactabular-table` import. It points to the correct package now.
  * Improvement - table - Drop `lodash/omit` dependency.

1.1.0 / 2016-08-03
==================

  * Improvement - edit - Allow `editingProps` (`value`/`onValue`) to be overridden.
  * Improvement - table - Added `getRef` for getting references to underlying DOM elements.
  * Improvement - sticky - Added `getRef` for getting references to underlying DOM elements.
  * Improvement - sticky - Moved `reactabular-table` as a peer dependency as I realized it's better to let the user decide which version of the table to use.
  * Improvement - easy - Dropped dependency on react-dom.

1.0.11 / 2016-07-29
===================

  * Bug fix - sort - `sort.reset` accepts object properly now. Earlier it bailed out too early.
  * Improvement - Add sorting numbers to the header so you know in which order sorting rules are applied.
  * Improvement - Allow column sorting status to be reset by doubleclicking on a column header.

1.0.10 / 2016-07-29
===================

  * Improvement - sort - `sort.sort` accepts `event` parameter now. It defaults to `onClick`.
  * Improvement - sort - `sort.reset` is a new transform that can be used to remove the given column from the sorting rules.
  * Improvement - sort - `sort.header` is a new formatter that can be used to apply sorting. This is handy if you use `sort.reset`.

1.0.8 / 2016-07-27
==================

  * Improvement - easy - Make `tableWidth` and `tableHeight` checks looser.

1.0.6 / 2016-07-27
==================

  * Bug fix - easy - Merge column definition `props.className` correctly. Previously it discarded possible value.
  * Improvement - easy - Add styling hooks. Now you can attach classes to the table structure (table, thead, tbody).
  * Improvement - easy - Add `onDragColumn` and `onMoveColumns` hooks.

1.0.5 / 2016-07-27
==================

  * Improvement - highlight - Do not pass `undefined` keys to `_highlights` data.
  * Improvement - easy - Add column visibility to the example.
  * Improvement - easy - Render `EasyTable` in a fixed viewport.
  * Bug fix - easy - Do not re-initialize styles if columns change. Without this CSS resets. I may have to revisit this decision but it seems logical now.
  * Improvement - easy - Support `draggable` header flag.

1.0.3 / 2016-07-27
==================

  * Improvement - sticky - Make `tableHeader` prop check looser.
  * Improvement - easy - Resolve nested and `cell.resolve` based data.
