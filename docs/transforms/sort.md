The `sort` transform has been designed to track when the user requests sorting and render possibly matching sorting condition as a class for styling. In addition you will need to use specific sort helpers to handle the sorting logic. The helpers have been encapsulated within the `sort` module.

**Example:**

```code
lang: jsx
---
...
import { transforms, sort } from 'reactabular';

...

const sortable = transforms.sort({
  // Point the transform to your data. React state can work for this purpose
  // but you can use a state manager as well.
  getSortingColumns: () => this.state.sortingColumns || {},

  // The user requested sorting, adjust the sorting state accordingly.
  // This is a good chance to pass the request through a sorter.
  onSort: selectedColumn => {
    this.setState({
      sortingColumns: sort.byColumns({ // sort.byColumn would work too
        sortingColumns: this.state.sortingColumns,
        selectedColumn
      })
    });
  }
});

...

// Mark a header as sortable
columns: [
  {
    header: {
      label: 'name',
      transforms: [sortable()]
    },
    cell: {
      property: 'name'
    }
  }
]
```
