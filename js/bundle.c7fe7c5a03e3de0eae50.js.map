The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.

His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.

It may contain multiple `Table.Header` and `Table.Body` elements. You can control data per body while the provider maintains a shared column definition.\\n\\n## `Table.Provider`\\n\\n`Table.Provider` is the core of Reactabular. It sets up a [context](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html) and maps the `column` definition to its children components. The following example illustrates the basic idea.\\n\\n```jsx\\n/*\\nimport { Table } from 'reactabular';\\n*/\\n\\nconst rows = [\\n  {\\n    id: 100,\\n    name: 'Adam',\\n    dad: 'John',\\n    lovesBeeGees: true\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 101,\\n    name: 'Brian',\\n    dad: 'George',\\n    lovesBeeGees: false\\n  },\\n];\\n\\nconst columns = [\\n  {\\n    property: 'name',\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'Name'\\n    }\\n  },\\n  {\\n    property: 'dad',\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'Dad'\\n    }\\n  }\\n];\\n\\n<Table.Provider\\n  className=\\\"pure-table pure-table-striped\\\"\\n  columns={columns}\\n>\\n  <Table.Header />\\n\\n  <Table.Body rows={rows} rowKey=\\\"id\\\" />\\n</Table.Provider>\\n```\\n\\n## `Table.Header`\\n\\n`Table.Header` renders a table header within a `Table.Provider` context.\\n\\n```react\\n<Table.Provider\\n  className=\\\"pure-table pure-table-striped\\\"\\n  columns={columns}\\n>\\n  <Table.Header />\\n\\n  <Table.Body rows={rows} rowKey=\\\"id\\\"/>\\n\\n  <Table.Header />\\n</Table.Provider>\\n```\\n\\n## Customizing `Table.Header`\\n\\nIt is possible to customize a header by passing child components to it. This way you can implement filtering per column for instance.\\n\\nHere `search.Columns` injects an additional row for the filter controls. An alternative way to handle it would be to push the problem to the column definition.\\n\\n```react\\n<Table.Provider\\n  className=\\\"pure-table pure-table-striped\\\"\\n  columns={columns}\\n>\\n  <Table.Header>\\n    <search.Columns\\n      query={{}}\\n      columns={columns}\\n      onChange={value => console.log('new value', value)}\\n    />\\n  </Table.Header>\\n\\n  <Table.Body rows={rows} rowKey=\\\"id\\\" />\\n</Table.Provider>\\n```\\n\\n## `Table.Body`\\n\\n`Table.Body` renders table `rows` within a `Table.Provider` context. It accepts either an array of objects or an array of arrays (see the [Excel example](/examples/excel)). In the former case you should define a `rowKey`. This allows React to render in a more performant way.\\n\\nMost often you'll define `rowKey` as a string. An alternative is to define it using a function like this: `rowKey={({ rowData, rowIndex }) => rowData.nested.id}`. This is useful if your key is nested or related to some other data. Another way to avoid this problem is to generate the field using `reactabular-resolve` and then point to that through a string.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```react\\n<Table.Provider\\n  className=\\\"pure-table pure-table-striped\\\"\\n  columns={columns}\\n>\\n  <Table.Header />\\n\\n  <Table.Body rows={rows.filter(r => r.name === 'Adam')} rowKey=\\\"id\\\" />\\n\\n  <Table.Header />\\n\\n  <Table.Body rows={rows.filter(r => r.name === 'Brian')} rowKey=\\\"id\\\" />\\n</Table.Provider>\\n```\\n\\n## Getting Refs\\n\\nSometimes you might need to access the underlying DOM nodes for measuring etc. This can be achieved as follows:\\n\\n```react\\nclass RefTable extends React.Component {\\n  constructor(props) {\\n    super(props);\\n\\n    this.onRow = this.onRow.bind(this);\\n\\n    this.headerRef = null;\\n    this.bodyRef = null;\\n  }\\n  render() {\\n    return (\\n      <Table.Provider columns={columns}>\\n        <Table.Header\\n          ref={header => {\\n            this.headerRef = header && header.getRef();\\n          }}\\n        />\\n        <Table.Body\\n          ref={body => {\\n            this.bodyRef = body && body.getRef();\\n          }}\\n          rows={rows}\\n          rowKey=\\\"id\\\"\\n          onRow={this.onRow}\\n        />\\n      </Table.Provider>\\n    );\\n  }\\n  onRow(row, { rowIndex, rowKey }) {\\n    return {\\n      onClick: () => console.log(this.headerRef, this.bodyRef)\\n    };\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n<RefTable />\\n```\\n\\n## Customizing `Table.Header` and `Table.Body` Rows\\n\\nIt is possible to customize body behavior on a row level. `onRow` prop accepts function `(row, { rowIndex, rowKey }) => ({...})` that allows you to set custom attributes per each row.\\n\\n```react\\nclass CustomTable extends React.Component {\\n  render() {\\n    return (\\n      <Table.Provider\\n        className=\\\"pure-table pure-table-striped\\\"\\n        columns={columns}\\n      >\\n        <Table.Header\\n          onRow={this.onHeaderRow}\\n        />\\n\\n        <Table.Body\\n          rows={rows}\\n          rowKey=\\\"id\\\"\\n          onRow={this.onBodyRow}\\n        />\\n      </Table.Provider>\\n    );\\n  }\\n  onHeaderRow(row, { rowIndex }) {\\n    return {\\n      onClick: () => console.log('clicked header row', row)\\n    };\\n  }\\n  onBodyRow(row, { rowIndex, rowKey }) {\\n    return {\\n      onClick: () => console.log('clicked body row', row)\\n    };\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n<CustomTable />\\n```\\n\\nIt's a good idea to define a possible `row` handler separately to avoid binding per each `render`. If you write the handler inline, it will bind each time `render()` is called and reduce performance slightly.\\n\\n## Customizing `Table` Footer\\n\\nIt is possible to inject a custom footer like this:\\n\\n```react\\n<Table.Provider\\n  className=\\\"pure-table pure-table-striped\\\"\\n  columns={columns}\\n>\\n  <Table.Header />\\n\\n  <Table.Body rows={rows} rowKey=\\\"id\\\" />\\n\\n  <tfoot>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td>Show custom rows here</td>\\n      <td>Show custom rows here</td>\\n    </tr>\\n  </tfoot>\\n</Table.Provider>\\n```\\n\\n## See Also\\n\\n* [Selection](http://reactabular.js.org/#/examples/selection)\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n/* 1470 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t\n\t    var React = __webpack_require__(1);\n\t    var PageRenderer = __webpack_require__(595);\n\t    if (PageRenderer.__esModule) {\n\t      PageRenderer = PageRenderer.default;\n\t    }\n\t    module.exports = React.createClass({\n\t      displayName: 'WrappedPageRenderer',\n\t      getInitialState: function() {\n\t        return {content: __webpack_require__(1471)};\n\t      },\n\t      componentWillMount: function() {\n\t        var component = this;\n\t        if (false) {\n\t          module.hot.accept(\"!!./../../node_modules/raw-loader/index.js!./styling.md\", function() {\n\t            component.setState({\n\t              content: require(\"!!./../../node_modules/raw-loader/index.js!./styling.md\")\n\t            })\n\t          })\n\t        }\n\t      },\n\t      render: function() {\n\t        return React.createElement(PageRenderer, {content: this.state.content});\n\t      }\n\t    });\n\t  \n\n/***/ },\n/* 1471 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"Reactabular doesn't force you to style in any particular way.

We can for instance inject `onClick` handler and perform sorting based on that. If a transform returns `children`, it will override rendering behavior making it possible to implement editors.\\n\\nThe idea of transforms is that they can inject `propTypes` to the current cell (same idea for header and content). In this case we inject `onClick` handler so that sorting works. If a transform returns `children`, it will override rendering behavior. This is useful for transforms like `edit`.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  header: {\\n    label: 'Name',\\n    transforms: [sortable]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo give you a concrete example of overriding, consider the example below:\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  header: {\\n    label: 'Name',\\n    transforms: [\\n      () => ({\\n        children: <span>override to show instead of value</span>\\n      })\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## **`header.formatters = [label => <string|React element>]`**\\n\\nIf manipulating `propTypes` isn't enough, you can `format` the output. This should return something React can display. The result will be displayed **within** a table cell.\\n\\nIn the following example we use it to inject an extra checkbox to the header cell.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  header: {\\n    label: 'Name',\\n    formatters: [\\n      name => (\\n        <div>\\n          <input\\n            type=\\\"checkbox\\\"\\n            onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}\\n            style={{ width: '20px' }}\\n          />\\n          <span>{name}</span>\\n        </div>\\n      )\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## **`header.props = <object>`**\\n\\nYou can set header specific props through `props`.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  header: {\\n    label: 'Name',\\n    props: {\\n      style: {\\n        width: 100\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n/* 1485 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t\n\t    var React = __webpack_require__(1);\n\t    var PageRenderer = __webpack_require__(595);\n\t    if (PageRenderer.__esModule) {\n\t      PageRenderer = PageRenderer.default;\n\t    }\n\t    module.exports = React.createClass({\n\t      displayName: 'WrappedPageRenderer',\n\t      getInitialState: function() {\n\t        return {content: __webpack_require__(1486)};\n\t      },\n\t      componentWillMount: function() {\n\t        var component = this;\n\t        if (false) {\n\t          module.hot.accept(\"!!./../../node_modules/raw-loader/index.js!./cell.md\", function() {\n\t            component.setState({\n\t              content: require(\"!!./../../node_modules/raw-loader/index.js!./cell.md\")\n\t            })\n\t          })\n\t        }\n\t      },\n\t      render: function() {\n\t        return React.createElement(PageRenderer, {content: this.state.content});\n\t      }\n\t    });\n\t  \n\n/***/ },\n/* 1486 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"In addition to `header` customization, it's essential to define how the rows should map to content.

Instead of typing out import and the related code, this takes some of that work away. You still have to connect the data processing portion, though.\\n\\n## API\\n\\nThe API provides a **bind** function that merges the given **extensions** together with the provided column definition.\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport * as extensions from 'reactabular-column-extensions';\\n\\n// Or you can cherry-pick\\nimport { bind } from 'sortabular';\\nimport { bind as bindExtensions } from 'sortabular';\\n```\\n\\n### Binding\\n\\n**`extensions.bind([<extension>]) => ([<column>]) => [<adjusted column>]`**\\n\\nThe binder accepts an array of extensions and a column definition. It adjusts the columns based on this information and merges the configuration emitted by extensions top to bottom.\\n\\nAn extension has to be an object like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  match(column) {\\n    // If a column has `demo` property set, evaluate and merge\\n    return column.demo;\\n  },\\n  evaluate(column) {\\n    // Emit a structure to attach to the column definition\\n    return {\\n      demo: true\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n> If you want to implement a custom extension, you can wrap the object to a function and set defaults there.\\n\\n### Extensions\\n\\n**`extensions.draggableHeader({ onMoveColumns: <function> }) => <extension>`**\\n\\n`draggableHeader` injects the configuration expected by `reactabular-dnd` if `header.draggable` is set. You still have to configure the rest, though.\\n\\n**`extensions.highlightCell() => <extension>`**\\n\\n`highlightCell` injects the configuration expected by highlighting functionality from `searchtabular` if `cell.highlight` is set. You have to connect the highlighting logic with your data processing to make this work.\\n\\n**`extensions.resizableHeader({ window, onDragColumnStart, onDragColumn, onDragColumnEnd, props }) => <extension>`**\\n\\n`resizableHeader` injects the configuration required for resizable headers if `header.resizable` is set. It accepts `window` so you can make resizing work in an iframe. Most often you don't need to touch the parameter, though. You should define `onDragColumn(width, { column }` handler and deal with the new width there. `reactabular-resizable` can be useful for that purpose. `props` allow you to inject custom styling/props to `resizable.column`.\\n\\n**`extensions.sortableHeader({ sortingColumns, onSort, props, strategy }) => <extension>`**\\n\\n`sortableHeader` is a light wrapper to `sortabular` that gets injected if `header.sortable` is set. It sets logic and user interface needed for altering sorting state. It also injects sort reset transform. `sortingColumns`, `onSort(sortingColumns)`, `props`, and `strategy` follow `sortabular` interface. `props` allow you to customize styling/props of `sortabular.sort`.\\n\\n**`extensions.toggleChildrenCell({ idField, parentField, onToggleShowingChildren, props, rows }) => <extension>`**\\n\\n`toggleChildrenCell` gets injected if `cell.toggleChildren` is set. It has been designed to work with nested tree data of `treetabular`. It allows you to customize tree `idField` and `parentField`. In addition you have to define what happens when children are toggled using `onToggleShowingChildren(rowIndex)`. If you want to customize `treetabular.toggleChildren`, you can pass `props` to it. The extension also expects you to pass the rows of your application to it.\\n\\n## Column Extension Example\\n\\nThe example below shows how the transformation works.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```jsx\\n/*\\nimport * as extensions from 'reactabular-column-extensions';\\n*/\\n\\nconst columns = [\\n  {\\n    property: 'color',\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'Color',\\n      draggable: true\\n    }\\n  },\\n  {\\n    property: 'name',\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'Name'\\n    },\\n    cell: {\\n      highlight: true\\n    }\\n  }\\n];\\n\\nconst extendedColumns = extensions.bind([\\n  extensions.draggableHeader({\\n    onMoveColumns: () => ({})\\n  }),\\n  extensions.highlightCell()\\n])(columns);\\n\\n<ul>{\\n  (extendedColumns).map((d, i) =>\\n    <li key={`value-${i}`}>{JSON.stringify(d, null, 2)}</li>\\n  )\\n}</ul>\\n```\\n\\n## License\\n\\nMIT.\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n/* 1495 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t  value: true\n\t});\n\t\n\t/* eslint-disable global-require, import/no-unresolved */\n\texports.default = function (rootPath) {\n\t  return {\n\t    title: 'Data',\n\t    pages: [{\n\t      path: rootPath + '/resolving',\n\t      title: 'Resolving',\n\t      component: __webpack_require__(1496)\n\t    }, {\n\t      path: rootPath + '/inline-editing',\n\t      title: 'Inline Editing',\n\t      component: __webpack_require__(1498)\n\t    }, {\n\t      path: rootPath + '/sorting',\n\t      title: 'Sorting',\n\t      component: __webpack_require__(1500)\n\t    }, {\n\t      path: rootPath + '/pagination',\n\t      title: 'Pagination',\n\t      component: __webpack_require__(1502)\n\t    }, {\n\t      path: rootPath + '/tree',\n\t      title: 'Tree',\n\t      component: __webpack_require__(1504)\n\t    }]\n\t  };\n\t};\n\n/***/ },\n/* 1496 */\n[1611, 1497],\n/* 1497 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/reactabular/table-resolver.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/reactabular/table-resolver) [![bitHound Score](https://www.bithound.io/github/reactabular/table-resolver/badges/score.svg)](https://www.bithound.io/github/reactabular/table-resolver) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/reactabular/table-resolver/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/reactabular/table-resolver)\\n\\n# table-resolver - Table resolution utilities\\n\\nSometimes your rows might come in a nested format or it might have a representation that maps to the underlying value. A name split to first and last parts is an example of the former. Country code to country mapping is an example of the latter.\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport * as resolve from 'table-resolver';\\n\\n// Or you can cherry-pick\\nimport { nested } from 'table-resolver';\\nimport { nested as resolveNested } from 'table-resolver';\\n```\\n\\n## API\\n\\nThe API consists of two parts: **row resolvers** and **column resolvers**. If you have complex data, use the former. Latter come in handy if you have a nested column definition that needs to be flattened so that it works with a component like Reactabular.\\n\\n## Row Resolvers\\n\\n`table-resolver` uses an iterator that accepts rows and then transforms it using a specific resolver method (or several, if they have been composed into one).\\n\\n### `resolve.resolve`\\n\\n**`({ columns: <columns>, method: <resolver function>, indexKey = '_index' }) => <rows> => <rows>`**\\n\\nThe `resolve` iterator is the heart of this package. It accepts columns and a method. When applied with rows, it will return resolved rows. The method is a function with signature like: `({ column }) => (rowData) => <resolved row>`. In most cases, the `nested` and `byFunction` methods provided in this package (or a composition of them) will be all you need.\\n\\nThe `resolve` iterator automatically injects into every resolved row object a field named `_index` containing the row's index. If `method` is not provided, `_index` is injected to the data automatically.\\n\\nIf your own resolver (e.g. `byFunction`) happens to also output a field named `_index`, it will overwrite the default one. In that case, if you still need the row index, you may wish to pass a different `indexKey` when calling `resolve`.\\n\\n### Method `resolve.nested`\\n\\n**`({ column }) => (rowData) => <resolved row>`**\\n\\nThe `nested` resolver digs rows from a `property: 'name.first'` kind of definition and maps the received value to property name. It replaces the original value with the resolved one. *Note*: instead of defining a path string `property: 'name.first'`, you may provide a custom getter function `property: data => (data.name || {}).first` directly. This may be slightly faster but needs to be done carefully to prevent TypeErrors due to missing values.\\n\\n### Method creator `resolve.byFunction`\\n\\n**`(path: <string>) => ({ column }) => (rowData) => <resolved row>`**\\n\\nThe `byFunction` resolver accepts a path from where to look for a resolving function. It could be `column.cell.resolve` for example and you can use a nested definition for getting it from your column definition.\\n\\nInstead of replacing the original value, `byFunction` generates `_<property>` kind of field to the resulting rows. This sort of implicit rule is useful for other functionality as it can rely on the same convention.\\n\\n## Column Resolvers\\n\\n### `resolve.columnChildren`\\n\\n**`({ columns, childrenField = 'children' }) => <resolved columns>`**\\n\\nAssuming your column definition is nested, this function resolves it to a flat format.\\n\\n### `resolve.headerRows`\\n\\n**`({ columns, childrenField = 'children' }) => <resolved columns>`**\\n\\nIf your column definition is nested, you have to resolve it to header rows. `resolve.headerRows` has been designed exactly for this purpose.\\n\\n## Combining Resolver Methods\\n\\nYou can easily combine resolver methods like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst resolver = resolve.resolve({\\n  columns,\\n  method: ({ rowData, column }) => resolve.byFunction('cell.resolve')({\\n    rowData: resolve.nested({ rowData, column }),\\n    column\\n  })\\n});\\n```\\n\\nor if you are already using Redux:\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport { compose } from 'redux';\\n\\n...\\n\\nconst resolver = resolve.resolve({\\n  columns,\\n  method: (extra) => compose(\\n    resolve.byFunction('cell.resolve')(extra),\\n    resolve.nested(extra)\\n  )\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## Resolution Example\\n\\nThe following example shows how you to resolve nested values.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```jsx\\n/*\\nimport * as resolve from 'table-resolver';\\n*/\\n\\nconst columns = [\\n  {\\n    property: 'color',\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'Color'\\n    }\\n  },\\n  {\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'Name'\\n    },\\n    children: [\\n      {\\n        property: 'name.first',\\n        header: {\\n          label: 'First Name'\\n        }\\n      },\\n      {\\n        property: 'name.last',\\n        header: {\\n          label: 'Last Name'\\n        }\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  },\\n  {\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'About'\\n    },\\n    children: [\\n      {\\n        property: 'company',\\n        header: {\\n          label: 'Company'\\n        }\\n      },\\n      {\\n        property: 'sentence',\\n        header: {\\n          label: 'Sentence'\\n        }\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n];\\n\\nconst rows = [\\n  {\\n    id: 1,\\n    color: 'red',\\n    name: {\\n      first: 'John',\\n      last: 'Johnson'\\n    },\\n    company: 'John Inc.',\\n    sentence: 'consequatur nihil minima corporis omnis nihil rem'\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 2,\\n    color: 'blue',\\n    name: {\\n      first: 'Mike',\\n      last: 'Mikeson'\\n    },\\n    company: 'Mike Inc.',\\n    sentence: 'a sequi doloremque sed id quo voluptatem voluptatem ut voluptatibus'\\n  }\\n];\\n\\n<ul>{\\n  resolve.resolve(\\n    {\\n      columns: resolve.columnChildren({ columns }),\\n      method: resolve.nested\\n    }\\n  )(rows).map((d, i) =>\\n    <li key={`value-${i}`}>{JSON.stringify(d, null, 2)}</li>\\n  )\\n}</ul>\\n```\\n\\n## License\\n\\nMIT.

These can be combined together to set up sort in various ways. There's control over the algorithm used as well as how it's bound to the user interface. You can also control how sorting is tracked (per column index or per property).\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport * as sort from 'sortabular';\\n\\n// Or you can cherry-pick\\nimport { byColumn } from 'sortabular';\\nimport { byColumn as sortByColumn } from 'sortabular';\\n```\\n\\n### Helpers\\n\\n**`sort.byColumn({ sortingColumns: <sorting columns>, sortingOrder: {FIRST: <string>, <string>: <string>}, selectedColumn: <string> }) => <sorting colums> || {}`**\\n\\n`sort.byColumn` allows you to sort per one column. It discards possible existing sorting state. If you are trying to sort the same column, it will cycle between ascending, descending, and no sorting. In case you are trying to sort some other column, it will start from the ascending state while discarding the existing sorting state.\\n\\n**`sort.byColumns({ sortingColumns: <sorting columns>, sortingOrder: {FIRST: <string>, <string>: <string>}, selectedColumn: <string> }) => <sorting columns> || {}`**\\n\\n`sort.byColumns` is like `sort.byColumn` except it doesn't discard possible existing sort state and instead accumulates it. This allows you to perform sorting over multiple columns while refining the results. The last-sorted column always has the highest `position` value, i.e. the lowest sorting priority.\\n\\n**`sort.byColumnsPrioritizeLastSorted({ sortingColumns: <sorting columns>, sortingOrder: {FIRST: <string>, <string>: <string>}, selectedColumn: <string> }) => <sorting columns> || {}`**\\n\\n`sort.byColumnsPrioritizeLastSorted` is like `sort.byColumns` except it\\nalways gives the last-sorted column the highest sorting priority.\\n\\n**`sort.sorter({ columns: [<object>], sortingColumns: <sorting columns>, sort: <function>, strategy = strategies.byIndex })([<rows to sort>]) => [<sorted rows>]`**\\n\\n`sort.sorter` sorts the passed `rows` using a `sortingColumns` definitions and a `sort` function. It has been designed to work based on [lodash.orderBy](https://lodash.com/docs#orderBy) signature.\\n\\nIf you want to evaluate columns in a reverse order instead of the default, you can reverse `sort` function like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst reverseSort = (data, columnIndexList, orderList) => (\\n  orderBy(data, columnIndexList.slice().reverse(), orderList.slice().reverse())\\n);\\n```\\n\\n### Transforms\\n\\n**`sort.sort = ({ event = 'onClick', getSortingColumns = () => [], strategy = strategies.byIndex, onSort = (columnIndex) => {} } = {}) => (value, { columnIndex }, props)`**\\n\\n`sort.sort` can be applied as a transform. It expects `getSortingColumns` and `onSort` callbacks. The former should return the sorting column data, the latter is called when the user sorts based on `event`.\\n\\n**`sort.reset = ({ event = 'onDoubleClick', getSortingColumns = () => [], strategy = strategies.byIndex, onReset = (columnIndex) => {} } = {}) => (value, { columnIndex }, props)`**\\n\\n`sort.reset` can be applied as a transform.

The former should return the sorting column data, the latter is called when the user sorts based on `event`.\\n\\n### Formatters\\n\\n**`sort.header = ({ sortable, strategy = strategies.byIndex, getSortingColumns = () => [] }) => (value, { columnIndex })`**\\n\\n`sort.header` can be used to sort within a header cell. This works will with `sort.reset` since then you can apply both reseting and sorting to the same cell without conflicts. It expects an initialized sortable (i.e., `sort.sort`) and `getSortingColumns`. If sorting is active at a column, it displays the current order number.\\n\\n`sortable` and `strategy` parameters are optional. `getSortingColumns` is required.\\n\\nYou can customize `props` of `sort.header` specific portions through the following protocol:\\n\\n```javascript\\nprops = {\\n  container: {},\\n  value: {},\\n  order: {}\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**`sort.order = ({ strategy = strategies.byIndex, getSortingColumns = () => [] }) => (value, { columnIndex })`**\\n\\n`sort.order` can be used to display a sorting arrow widget. It figures out the class name based on the current sorting status. `sort.header` uses this internally.\\n\\n### Strategies\\n\\nMost of the functions accept a strategy. This allows you to modify their sorting behavior. By default they'll track sorting by column index. It's possible to change it to sort by property.\\n\\n**`sort.strategies.byIndex`**\\n\\n`byIndex` is the default strategy used by other functions. It literally means the system will track sorting per index.\\n\\n**`sort.strategies.byProperty`**\\n\\n`byProperty` ties sorting state to column property. This can be useful if you want to retain the sorting state within a column while moving it around.\\n\\n## Sorting Protocol\\n\\nSorting relies on a structure like this to describe what is being sorted and in what order:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst sortingColumns = {\\n  0: {\\n    direction: 'asc',\\n    position: 1\\n  },\\n  1: {\\n    direction: 'desc',\\n    position: 0\\n  }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIt maps column index to sorting state and can contain multiple sorters.\\n\\n## Customizing Sorting Order\\n\\nIt is possible to customize the sorting order of `sort.byColumn` and `sort.byColumns` by passing an object describing the sorting. It should contain `FIRST` key to describe the starting point. The remaining key-value pairs should form a cycle.\\n\\nAssuming you are using the `sort` transform, the order values are used for generating the classes you see at the user interface.\\n\\nThe default order cycles between `asc`, `desc`, and `''` (no sort).\\n\\nYou could implement a custom order cycling between `asc` and `desc` like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst sortingOrder = {\\n  FIRST: 'asc',\\n  asc: 'desc',\\n  desc: 'asc'\\n};\\n```\\n\\n## The `sort` Transform\\n\\nThe `sort` transform has been designed to track when the user requests sorting and render possibly matching sorting condition as a class for styling. In addition you will need to use specific sort helpers to handle the sorting logic. The helpers have been encapsulated within the `sort` module.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```javascript\\n...\\nimport * as sort from 'sortabular';\\n\\n...\\n\\nconst sortable = sort.sort({\\n  // Point the transform to your rows. React state can work for this purpose\\n  // but you can use a state manager as well.\\n  getSortingColumns: () => this.state.sortingColumns || [],\\n\\n  // The user requested sorting, adjust the sorting state accordingly.\\n  // This is a good chance to pass the request through a sorter.\\n  onSort: selectedColumn => {\\n    this.setState({\\n      sortingColumns: sort.byColumns({ // sort.byColumn would work too\\n        sortingColumns: this.state.sortingColumns,\\n        selectedColumn\\n      })\\n    });\\n  }\\n});\\n\\n...\\n\\n// Mark a header as sortable\\ncolumns: [\\n  {\\n    property: 'name',\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'name',\\n      transforms: [sortable]\\n    }\\n  }\\n]\\n```\\n\\n## How to Use?\\n\\nThe general workflow goes as follows:\\n\\n1. Set up the `sort` transform. Its purpose is to track when the user requests sorting and render possibly matching sorting condition as a class for styling.\\n2. Set up a sort helper. There are helpers for sorting per one column (`sort.byColumn`) and one for sorting per multiple columns (`sort.byColumns`). The helpers handle managing sorting conditions and actual sorting. If you have a back-end, you can skip the latter.\\n3. Sort the rows before rendering.\\n4. Feed the sorted rows to a `Table`.\\n\\n> You can find suggested default styling for the package at `style.css` in the package root.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```jsx\\n/*\\nimport React from 'react';\\nimport orderBy from 'lodash/orderBy';\\nimport * as resolve from 'table-resolver';\\nimport * as Table from 'reactabular-table';\\nimport * as sort from 'sortabular';\\nimport { compose } from 'redux';\\n*/\\n\\nconst initialRows = [\\n  {\\n    id: 100,\\n    name: {\\n      first: 'Adam',\\n      last: 'West'\\n    },\\n    age: 10\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 101,\\n    name: {\\n      first: 'Brian',\\n      last: 'Eno'\\n    },\\n    age: 43\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 102,\\n    name: {\\n      first: 'Brian',\\n      last: 'Wilson'\\n    },\\n    age: 23\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 103,\\n    name: {\\n      first: 'Jake',\\n      last: 'Dalton'\\n    },\\n    age: 33\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 104,\\n    name: {\\n      first: 'Jill',\\n      last: 'Jackson'\\n    },\\n    age: 63\\n  }\\n];\\n\\nclass SortTable extends React.Component {\\n  constructor(props) {\\n    super(props);\\n\\n    const getSortingColumns = () => this.state.sortingColumns || {};\\n    const sortable = sort.sort({\\n      // Point the transform to your rows.

It allows you to set up collapsible rows that can contain more collapsible ones while remaining within a table format.\\n\\nTo achieve this, `treetabular` relies on a flat structure that contains the hierarchy:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst tree = [\\n  {\\n    id: 123,\\n    name: 'Demo'\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 456,\\n    name: 'Another',\\n    parent: 123\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 789,\\n    name: 'Yet Another',\\n    parent: 123\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 532,\\n    name: 'Foobar'\\n  }\\n];\\n```\\n\\nIf there's a `parent` relation, the children must follow their parent right after it (you might use `fixOrder` helper function if your data does not meet that criteria).\\n\\n> You can find suggested default styling for the package at `style.css` in the package root.\\n\\n## API\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport * as tree from 'treetabular';\\n\\n// Or you can cherry-pick\\nimport { filter } from 'treetabular';\\nimport { filter as filterTree } from 'treetabular';\\n```\\n\\n### Transformations\\n\\n**`tree.collapseAll = ({ property = 'showingChildren' }) => (rows) => [<collapsedRow>]`**\\n\\nCollapses rows by setting `showingChildren` of each row to `false`.\\n\\n**`tree.expandAll = ({ property = 'showingChildren' }) => (rows) => [<expandedRow>]`**\\n\\nExpands rows by setting `showingChildren` of each row to `true`.\\n\\n**`tree.filter = ({ fieldName, idField = 'id', parentField = 'parent' }) => (rows) => [<filteredRow>]`**\\n\\nFilters the given rows using `fieldName`. This is handy if you want only rows that are visible assuming visibility logic has been defined.\\n\\n### Queries\\n\\n**`tree.getLevel = ({ index, idField = 'parentId', parentField = 'parent' }) => (rows) => <level>`**\\n\\nReturns the nesting level of the row at the given `index` within `rows`.\\n\\n**`tree.getChildren = ({ index, idField = 'id', parentField = 'parent' }) => (rows) => [<child>]`**\\n\\nReturns children based on given `rows` and `index`. This includes children of children.\\n\\n**`tree.getImmediateChildren = ({ index, idField = 'id', parentField = 'parent' }) => (rows) => [<child>]`**\\n\\nReturns immediate children based on given `rows` and `index`.\\n\\n**`tree.getParents = ({ index, idField = 'parentId', parentField = 'parent' }) => (rows) => [<parent>]`**\\n\\nReturns parents based on given `rows` and `index`.\\n\\n**`tree.hasChildren = ({ index, idField = 'id', parentField = 'parent '}) => (rows) => <boolean>`**\\n\\nReturns a boolean based on whether or not the row at the given `index` has children.\\n\\n**`tree.search = ({ operation: (rows) => [<row>], idField = 'id', parentField = 'parent' }) => (rows) => [<searchedRow>]`**\\n\\nSearches against a tree structure using `operation` while matching against children too. If children are found, associated parents are returned as well. This has been designed to [searchtabular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/searchtabular) `multipleColumns` and `singleColumn`, but as long as the passed operation follows the interface, it should fit in.\\n\\n> This depends on [resolve.resolve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/table-resolver#resolveresolve)!\\n\\n**`tree.wrap = ({ operations: [rows => rows], idField = 'id' }) => (rows) => [<operatedRow>]`**\\n\\nIf you want to perform an operation, such as sorting, against the root rows of a tree, use `tree.wrap`.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```javascript\\nwrap({\\n  operations: [\\n    sorter({\\n      columns,\\n      sortingColumns,\\n      sort: orderBy\\n    })\\n  ]\\n})(rows);\\n```\\n\\n### Packing\\n\\n**`tree.pack = ({ parentField = 'parent', childrenField = 'children', idField = 'id' }) => (rows) => [<packedRow>]`**\\n\\nPacks children inside root level nodes. This is useful with sorting and filtering.\\n\\n**`tree.unpack = ({ parentField = 'parent', childrenField = 'children', idField = 'id', parent }) => (rows) => [<unpackedRow>]`**\\n\\nUnpacks children from root level nodes. This is useful with sorting and filtering.\\n\\n### Drag and Drop\\n\\n**`tree.moveRows = ({ operation: (rows) => [<row>], retain = [], idField = 'id', parentField = 'parent' }) => (rows) => [<movedRow>]`**\\n\\nAllows moving tree rows while `retain`ing given fields at their original rows. You should pass an `operation` that performs actual moving here. [reactabular-dnd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactabular-dnd) `moveRows` is one option.\\n\\n### UI\\n\\n**`tree.toggleChildren = ({ getIndex, getRows, getShowingChildren, toggleShowingChildren, props, idField = 'id', parentField, toggleEvent = 'DoubleClick' }) => (value, extra) => <React element>`**\\n\\nMakes it possible to toggle node children through a user interface.  \\nPass `\\\"indent\\\":false` inside `props` object if you want to disable automatic indentation.\\n\\nThe default implementation of `getIndex(rowData)` depends on [resolve.resolve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/table-resolver#resolveresolve) as it looks for index of the row to toggle based on that. This can be customized through.\\n\\n### Helpers\\n\\n**`tree.fixOrder = ({ parentField = 'parent', idField = 'id' }) => (rows) => [<rows in correct order>]`**\\n\\nIf children in your rows don't follow their parents you can use that helper method so they will be moved into right place.\\n\\nBasically it converts `[ parent, x, y, z, children ]` into `[ parent, children, x, y, z ]`.\\n\\n## Example\\n\\n```jsx\\n/*\\nimport React from 'react';\\nimport cloneDeep from 'lodash/cloneDeep';\\nimport orderBy from 'lodash/orderBy';\\nimport { compose } from 'redux';\\nimport * as resolve from 'table-resolver';\\nimport VisibilityToggles from 'reactabular-visibility-toggles';\\nimport * as Table from 'reactabular-table';\\nimport * as tree from 'treetabular';\\nimport * as search from 'searchtabular';\\nimport * as sort from 'sortabular';\\n\\nimport {\\n  generateParents, generateRows\\n} from './helpers';\\n*/\\n\\nconst schema = {\\n  type: 'object',\\n  properties: {\\n    id: {\\n      type: 'string'\\n    },\\n    name: {\\n      type: 'string'\\n    },\\n    age: {\\n      type: 'integer'\\n    }\\n  },\\n  required: ['id', 'name', 'age']\\n};\\n\\nclass TreeTable extends React.Component {\\n  constructor(props) {\\n    super(props);\\n\\n    const columns = this.getColumns();\\n    const rows = resolve.resolve({ columns })(\\n      generateParents(generateRows(100, schema))\\n    );\\n\\n    this.state = {\\n      searchColumn: 'all',\\n      query: {},\\n      sortingColumns: null,\\n      rows,\\n      columns\\n    };\\n\\n    this.onExpandAll = this.onExpandAll.bind(this);\\n    this.onCollapseAll = this.onCollapseAll.bind(this);\\n    this.onToggleColumn = this.onToggleColumn.bind(this);\\n  }\\n  getColumns() {\\n    const sortable = sort.sort({\\n      // Point the transform to your rows.

It consists of search algorithms that can be applied to the rows. Just like with sorting, you have to apply it to the rows just before rendering. A column is considered searchable in case it has a unique `property` defined.\\n\\n## API\\n\\nThe search API consists of three parts. Out of these `search.multipleColumns` and `search.matches` are the most useful ones for normal usage. If the default search strategies aren't enough, it's possible to implement more as long as you follow the same interface.\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport * as search from 'searchtabular';\\n\\n// Or you can cherry-pick\\nimport { multipleColumns } from 'searchtabular';\\nimport { multipleColumns as searchMultipleColumns } from 'searchtabular';\\n```\\n\\n### Search\\n\\n**`search.multipleColumns({ castingStrategy: <castingStrategy>, columns: [<object>], query: {<column>: <query>}, strategy: <strategy>, transform: <transform> })([<rows to query>]) => [<filtered rows>]`**\\n\\nThis is the highest level search function available. It expects `rows` and `columns` in the same format the `Table` uses. `query` object describes column specific search queries.\\n\\nIt uses `infix` strategy underneath although it is possible to change it. By default it matches in a case **insensitive** manner. If you want case sensitive behavior, pass `a => a`(identity function) as `transform`.\\n\\nIt will cast everything but arrays to a string by default. If you want a custom casting behavior, pass a custom function to `castingStrategy(value, column)`. It should return the cast result.\\n\\n**`search.singleColumn({ castingStrategy: <castingStrategy>, columns: [<object>], searchColumn: <string>, query: <string>, strategy: <strategy>, transform: <transform> })([<rows to query>]) => [<filtered rows>]`**\\n\\nThis is a more specialized version of `search.multipleColumns`. You can use it to search a specific column through `searchColumn` and `query`.\\n\\n### Matchers\\n\\n**`search._columnMatches({ query: <string>, castingStrategy: <castingStrategy>, column: <object>, row: <object>, strategy: <strategy>, transform: <transform> }) => <boolean>`**\\n\\nThis is a function that can be used to figure out all column specific matches. It is meant only for **internal usage** of the library.\\n\\nWhen dealing with strings:\\n\\n**`search.matches({ value: <string>, query: <string>, strategy: <strategy>, transform: <transform> }) => [{ startIndex: <number>, length: <number> }]`**\\n\\nReturns an array with the matches.\\n\\nWhen dealing with arrays:\\n\\n**`search.matches({ value: <string>, query: [<string|[...]>], strategy: <strategy>, transform: <transform> }) => [[{ startIndex: <number>, length: <number> }], ...]`**\\n\\nReturns a sparse array with the same shape as the original query. If there was a match for an item, it will have the same shape as the string version above, otherwise the array will have a hole in that location.\\n\\nThis function returns matches against the given value and query. This is particularly useful with highlighting.\\n\\n### Strategies\\n\\n**`search.strategies.infix(queryTerm: <string>) => { evaluate(searchText: <string>) => <string>, matches(searchText) => [{ startIndex: <number>, length: <number> }]`**\\n\\nSearch uses `infix` strategy by default. This means it will match even if the result is in the middle of a `searchText`.\\n\\nThe strategies operate in two passes - evaluation and matching. The evaluation pass allows us to implement perform fast boolean check on whether or not a search will match. Matching gives exact results.\\n\\n**`search.strategies.prefix(queryTerm: <string>) => { evaluate(searchText: <string>) => <string>, matches(searchText) => [{ startIndex: <number>, length: <number> }]`**\\n\\n`prefix` strategy matches from the start.\\n\\n## Highlighting Search Results\\n\\nTo make it possible to highlight search results per column, there's a specific `highlightCell` formatter.\\n\\n## How to Use?\\n\\nThe general workflow goes as follows:\\n\\n1. Set up a `Search` control that outputs a query in `{<column>: <query>}` format. If `<column>` is `all`, then the search will work against all columns. Otherwise it will respect the exact columns set. You'll most likely want to use either `reactabular-search-field` or `reactabular-search-columns` (or both) for this purpose or provide an implementation of your own if you are not using Reactabular.\\n2. Before rendering the rows, perform `search.multipleColumns({ columns, query })(rows)`. This will filter the rows based on the passed `rows`, `columns` definition, and `query`. A lazy way to do this is to filter at `render()` although you can do it elsewhere too to optimize rendering.\\n3. Pass the filtered rows to `Table`.\\n\\nTo use it, you'll first you have to annotate your rows using `highlighter`. It attaches a structure like this there:\\n\\n```javascript\\n_highlights: {\\n  demo: [{ startIndex: 0, length: 4 }]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```jsx\\n/*\\nimport React from 'react';\\nimport { compose } from 'redux';\\nimport * as Table from 'reactabular-table';\\nimport * as resolve from 'table-resolver';\\nimport * as search from 'searchtabular';\\n*/\\n\\nclass HighlightTable extends React.Component {\\n  constructor(props) {\\n    super(props);\\n\\n    this.state = {\\n      searchColumn: 'all',\\n      query: {},\\n      columns: [\\n        {\\n          header: {\\n            label: 'Name'\\n          },\\n          children: [\\n            {\\n              property: 'name.first',\\n              header: {\\n                label: 'First Name'\\n              },\\n              cell: {\\n                formatters: [search.highlightCell]\\n              }\\n            },\\n            {\\n              property: 'name.last',\\n              header: {\\n                label: 'Last Name'\\n              },\\n              cell: {\\n                formatters: [search.highlightCell]\\n              }\\n            }\\n          ]\\n        },\\n        {\\n          property: 'age',\\n          header: {\\n            label: 'Age'\\n          },\\n          cell: {\\n            formatters: [search.highlightCell]\\n          }\\n        }\\n      ],\\n      rows: [\\n        {\\n          id: 100,\\n          name: {\\n            first: 'Adam',\\n            last: 'West'\\n          },\\n          age: 10\\n        },\\n        {\\n          id: 101,\\n          name: {\\n            first: 'Brian',\\n            last: 'Eno'\\n          },\\n          age: 43\\n        },\\n        {\\n          id: 103,\\n          name: {\\n            first: 'Jake',\\n            last: 'Dalton'\\n          },\\n          age: 33\\n        },\\n        {\\n          id: 104,\\n          name: {\\n            first: 'Jill',\\n            last: 'Jackson'\\n          },\\n          age: 63\\n        }\\n      ]\\n    };\\n  }\\n  render() {\\n    const { searchColumn, columns, rows, query } = this.state;\\n    const resolvedColumns = resolve.columnChildren({ columns });\\n    const resolvedRows = resolve.resolve({\\n      columns: resolvedColumns,\\n      method: resolve.nested\\n    })(rows);\\n    const searchedRows = compose(\\n      search.highlighter({\\n        columns: resolvedColumns,\\n        matches: search.matches,\\n        query\\n      }),\\n      search.multipleColumns({\\n        columns: resolvedColumns,\\n        query\\n      }),\\n    )(resolvedRows);\\n\\n    return (\\n      <div>\\n        <div className=\\\"search-container\\\">\\n          <span>Search</span>\\n          <search.Field\\n            column={searchColumn}\\n            query={query}\\n            columns={resolvedColumns}\\n            rows={resolvedRows}\\n            onColumnChange={searchColumn => this.setState({ searchColumn })}\\n            onChange={query => this.setState({ query })}\\n          />\\n        </div>\\n        <Table.Provider columns={resolvedColumns}>\\n          <Table.Header\\n            headerRows={resolve.headerRows({ columns })}\\n          />\\n\\n          <Table.Body rows={searchedRows} rowKey=\\\"id\\\" />\\n        </Table.Provider>\\n      </div>\\n    );\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n<HighlightTable />\\n```\\n\\n## Components\\n\\n`searchtabular` provides a couple of convenience components listed below.\\n\\n### Searching Columns\\n\\n`searchtabular.Columns` is a single component you can inject within a table header to allow searching per column.

It provides two functions:\\n\\n* `column({ parent = document, onDrag, minWidth = 10, props: { ... }})`. This formatter does most of the work.\\n* `helper({ globalId, getId })` returns an object with `initialize({ columns, getId: (column, index) => ...})`, `cleanup()`, and `update({ column, width })` methods. The helper can be used with the formatter to implement performant resizing. It utilizes CSS stylesheets for this purpose. It also expects you set `width` per each column at your column definition.\\n\\nNote that the current implementation doesn't constrain the total width of the table. That would require additional logic as you would have to check for this while altering a column width.\\n\\n## How to Use?\\n\\nThe following example adjusts column widths through CSS to keep the performance high while using a sticky header/body.

The API consists of a single higher order function: `select.byArrowKeys({ rows: <rows>, selectedRowIndex: <number>, onSelectRow: (selectedRowIndex) => <any>})(<React element>) => <React element>`\\n\\nIf there is a selection (`selectedRowIndex`), then it triggers `onSelectRow` with the new `selectedRowIndex` which you can then use to update your selection state.\\n\\n### How to Use?\\n\\nThe following example illustrates how to use the functionality with a Reactabular based table.

Rather than implementing a lot of functionality in its core, it provides extension points. You can, for instance, customize rendering on cell level. It is possible to implement functionality, such as search, pagination, sorting, and inline editing, through composition. The library includes a variety of utilities for this even though you may use third party ones as well.\\n\\nBy default Reactabular operates using a column and a data definition. It doesn't care where those come from. It just renders the table for you. This means Reactabular will fit right into your current data architecture. It doesn't constrain it in any manner.\\n\\nThe chosen approach pushes a lot of complexity out of the core. As a result it might take more code to achieve certain functionalities. This is the price of flexibility. And that's the primary design goal of Reactabular.\\n\\n> If you want to learn more about React, read [SurviveJS - Webpack and React](http://survivejs.com/).\\n\\n## Example\\n\\nThe following example illustrates the approach used by Reactabular:\\n\\n```jsx\\n/*\\nimport * as Table from 'reactabular-table';\\n*/\\n\\nconst rows = [\\n  {\\n    id: 100,\\n    name: 'John',\\n    tools: {\\n      hammer: true\\n    },\\n    country: 'fi'\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 101,\\n    name: 'Jack',\\n    tools: {\\n      hammer: false\\n    },\\n    country: 'dk'\\n  }\\n];\\nconst countries = {\\n  fi: 'Finland',\\n  dk: 'Denmark'\\n};\\n\\nconst columns = [\\n  {\\n    property: 'name',\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'Name',\\n      transforms: [\\n        label => ({\\n          onClick: () => alert(`clicked ${label}`)\\n        })\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  },\\n  {\\n    property: 'tools',\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'Active',\\n      transforms: [\\n        label => ({\\n          onClick: () => alert(`clicked ${label}`)\\n        })\\n      ]\\n    },\\n    cell: {\\n      formatters: [\\n        tools => tools.hammer ? 'Hammertime' : 'nope'\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  },\\n  {\\n    property: 'country',\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'Country',\\n      transforms: [\\n        label => ({\\n          onClick: () => alert(`clicked ${label}`)\\n        })\\n      ]\\n    },\\n    cell: {\\n      formatters: [\\n        country => countries[country]\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  },\\n];\\n\\n<Table.Provider\\n  className=\\\"pure-table pure-table-striped\\\"\\n  columns={columns}\\n>\\n  <Table.Header />\\n\\n  <Table.Body rows={rows} rowKey=\\\"id\\\" />\\n</Table.Provider>\\n```\\n\\n## Available Packages\\n\\nThe following image shows roughly what packages are available. You will need to install them individually based on your needs. It is possible to use packages beyond these, but the ones listed below are maintained within the Reactabular organization:\\n\\n![Reactabular packages](./images/overall.png)\\n\\n## Testimonials\\n\\n> If you've struggled with other React table components, you'll see why this one is the best! - [Tim Dorr](https://twitter.com/timdorr/status/750346565374455808)\\n\\n---\\n\\n> It’s not a regular table component it’s a whole framework to work with tables: sorting, drag’n’drop, filtering, etc. And it’s easy to change every part if you need something specific. - [Artem Sapegin](http://sapegin.me/)\\n\\n---\\n\\n> Great work with reactabular!

The biggest changes have to do with the column definition (`formatters [<fn>]` over `format: <fn>`, no support for nested columns out of the box), resolving (composes better), and `reactabular-easy` partitioning (better API for the future).\\n\\n## Reorganization\\n\\n`reactabular` wrapper package has been dropped. As a result no standalone builds are available anymore. This has to do with the fact that the project has been split up into smaller parts that maintaining one didn't make any sense.\\n\\nThis means that in order to use the basic table without any bells and whistles you will have to `import * as Table from 'reactabular-table';` over `import { Table } from 'reactabular';`\\n\\nThe following packages have been moved to standalone projects:\\n\\n  * `reactabular-search` is [searchtabular](https://github.com/reactabular/searchtabular) now.\\n  * `reactabular-tree` is [treetabular](https://github.com/reactabular/treetabular) now.\\n  * `reactabular-resolve` is [table-resolver](https://github.com/reactabular/table-resolver) now.\\n  * `reactabular-highlight` has been integrated to `searchtabular`. You get `search.highlighter`, `search.highlightCell`, and `search.highlightValue` now.\\n  * `reactabular-search-columns` has been integrated to `searchtabular`. You can access it through `search.Columns`.\\n  * `reactabular-search-field` has been integrated to `searchtabular`. You can access it through `search.Field`.\\n  * `reactabular-sort` is [sortabular](https://github.com/reactabular/sortabular) now.\\n  * `reactabular-select` was integrated into [selectabular](https://github.com/reactabular/selectabular). You can access it through `import { byArrowKeys } from 'selectabular';`.\\n  * `react-edit` is functionally the same as before except it is in a repository of its own. This makes it possible to keep its versioning out of sync with the rest as it moves slower.\\n  * `reactabular-visibility-toggles` has been pushed to [react-visibility-toggles](https://github.com/reactabular/react-visibility-toggles) with several improvements and full test coverage.\\n\\n`reactabular-utils` doesn't exist anymore as the functionality has been split up into `reactabular-table` and `table-resolver`.\\n\\n## No More Nested Support Out of the Box\\n\\nReactabular doesn't support nested column definitions out of the box anymore. Earlier they did, but the logic didn't. To fix this, the related resolving pass was moved outside of the core. Even though it's more code, now all the logic (search/sorting/...) works with nested definitions and you have control over naming and the conventions you prefer.\\n\\n  * Breaking - `resizableColumn` isn't included in the core distribution anymore. You should use `reactabular-resizable` instead.\\n  * Breaking - Official support for lodash 3 has been dropped.\\n\\n## reactabular-dnd\\n\\n  * Feature - Expose `dnd.draggableRow`. This allows you to use row dragging with virtualization. Example: `body.row = dnd.draggableRow(Virtualized.BodyRow)`.\\n  * Feature - `dnd.draggableRow` hooks into row level (`onRow({ rowId })`) props `onCanMove({ rowId })`, `onMoveStart({ rowId })`, `onMove({ sourceRowId, targetRowId })`, and `onMoveEnd({ rowId })` instead of just `onMove`.\\n  * Feature - Fail fas if `moveLabels` is missing data.\\n  * Feature - Expose `move` core algorithm. This can be useful standalone.\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Feature - Support row dragging. This has been exposed through `onMoveRow({ sourceRowId, targetRowId })`. You are expected to call an algorithm that actually moves the row there. `reactabular-dnd` implements these. Note that this works only while there is no sorting or search query in place!\\n  * Bug fix - Inject `className` per row only if it has been defined at `onRow`.\\n  * Bug fix - If a column has width set, set `maxWidth` to it as well. #238\\n  * Breaking - The API has been partitioned so that the column definition related functionality is bound separately. This makes it possible to implement nested column functionality on top of it. Consider the example below and see the README for more:\\n\\n```javascript\\n...\\n\\nrender() {\\n  ...\\n\\n  const newColumns = easy.bindColumns({\\n    toggleChildrenProps: { className: 'toggle-children' },\\n    sortingColumns,\\n    rows,\\n    idField,\\n    parentField,\\n    props: this.props,\\n\\n    // Handlers\\n    onMoveColumns: this.onMoveColumns,\\n    onSort: this.onSort,\\n    onDragColumn: this.onDragColumn,\\n    onToggleShowingChildren: this.onToggleShowingChildren\\n  })(columns);\\n\\n  ...\\n}\\n\\n...\\n```\\n\\n## reactabular-table\\n\\n  * Feature - Pass whole column through header/body for extra parameters.\\n  * Feature - Support `onRow` at `Table.Header`.\\n  * Feature - Allow `Table.Header` to accept `headerRows` (an array of column definitions) to override default columns. See below.\\n  * Feature - Move `utils.resolveRowKey`, `utils.evaluateFormatters`, `utils.evaluateTransforms`, `utils.mergeProps`, `utils.columnsAreEqual` to `reactabular-table`.\\n  * Bug fix - Skip functions at `BodyRow` `shouldComponentUpdate`.\\n  * Breaking - Generalize `format: <fn>` as `formatters: [<fn>]`. The formatters are applied recursively from left to right: `[f1, f2, f3] => f1(f2(f3(value, extra)))`. This allows composition.\\n  * Breaking - Extract nested column logic. Now you will have to resolve nested columns before passing them to the table. The advantage of doing this is that now all logic (search/sorting/etc.) works with nested tables. Basic idea:\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport { resolve } from 'reactabular';\\n// or\\n// import * as resolve from 'table-resolver';\\n\\n...\\n\\nconst NestedColumnsTable = () => {\\n  const resolvedColumns = resolve.columnChildren({ columns });\\n  const resolvedRows = resolve.resolve({\\n    columns: resolvedColumns,\\n    method: resolve.nested\\n  })(rows);\\n\\n  return (\\n    <Table.Provider columns={resolvedColumns}>\\n      <Table.Header\\n        headerRows={resolve.headerRows({ columns })}\\n      />\\n\\n      <Table.Body\\n        rows={resolvedRows}\\n        rowKey=\\\"id\\\"\\n      />\\n    </Table.Provider>\\n  );\\n};\\n\\n...\\n```\\n\\n## reactabular-resizable\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow `minWidth` to be set per `column` explicitly.\\n  * Breaking - Push performance optimized resizing to a function. As a result `reactabular-resizable` exposes `column` and `helper` functions now. `column` is the same as before. `helper` implements optional performance optimizations. See the README for usage instructions.\\n\\n## reactabular-virtualized\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Improve horizontal scrolling performance when used with reactabular-sticky. If it detects Y didn't change while scrolling, it skips rendering now.\\n  * Bug fix - Skip functions at `BodyRow` `shouldComponentUpdate`.\\n  * Breaking - Speed up vertical scrolling by implementing `shouldComponentUpdate` for rows. Now it detects whether or not a row has been measured and also does check based on column and row changes like default SCU at reactabular-table.\\n\\n## reactabular-column-extensions\\n\\n  * New package to wrap common configuration.\\n\\n7.0.0 / 2016-11-03\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-dnd\\n\\n  * Breaking - Rework `moveRows` interface. Instead of `moveRows(rows, { sourceRowId, targetRowId }) => rows` it's `moveRows({ rows, sourceRowId, targetRowId }) => rows` now.\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Pass `parentField` to `tree.filter`. Now toggling should work.\\n  * Breaking - Push `onMoveColumns` behavior out of table core. Now it doesn't maintain table state at all. As a result you need to implement `onMoveColumns` handler like this to make column moving work:\\n\\n```javascript\\nonMoveColumns({ columns, source, target }) {\\n  this.setState({ columns });\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## reactabular-select\\n\\n  * Breaking - Push logic to [selectabular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selectabular). See the selection demo (features -> selecting rows) for the new, more powerful API.\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Allow `tree.toggleChildren` to work without column `props` defined.\\n  * Feature - Add `tree.getImmediateChildren`.\\n  * Feature - Add `tree.moveRows`.\\n  * Breaking - Refactor `tree.filter` as `({ fieldName, parentField = 'parent' }) => (rows) => filteredRows`.\\n\\n## reactabular-utils\\n\\n  * Bug fix - If `rowKey` value is zero, `resolveRowKey` should return `0-row`.\\n  * Feature - Allow `colSpan` and `rowSpan` to be overridden at `resolveHeaderRows`.\\n\\n6.1.2 / 2016-10-31\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Fix `onRow` behavior (match interface with `reactabular-table`). #229\\n\\n6.1.1 / 2016-10-27\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-search\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Return `false` if `property` is not defined. #228\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Allow `tree.filter` `parent` to be zero.\\n\\n6.1.0 / 2016-10-25\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Make sure `idField` `prop` works correctly. `tree.sort` needed to receive `idField` for the logic to work.\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow `idField` to be passed to `tree.sort`.\\n\\n6.0.3 / 2016-10-19\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Bump peer version ranges to avoid npm warnings.\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Bump peer version ranges to avoid npm warnings.\\n\\n## reactabular-virtualized\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Bump peer version ranges to avoid npm warnings.\\n\\n6.0.2 / 2016-10-19\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Feature - Add an example showing how to access `scrollTo`.\\n\\n6.0.0 / 2016-10-14\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Breaking - Expose `idField` and `parentField` `props` for customizing tree field types. Earlier `rowKey` handled `idField` but now it has been separated for clarity.\\n  * Breaking - Drop `styles` prop. Use `props` instead.\\n\\n## reactabular-search\\n\\n  * Breaking - `search.multipleColumns` and `search.singleColumn` now accept a `castingStrategy` parameter to define how to cast properties when searching. By default, everything by arrays is cast to a string.\\n  * Feature - `search.matches` now traverses arrays and returns results in the same shape.\\n\\n## reactabular-search-columns\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Make toggling behavior rely on `property` over `id`. Now the behavior is more consistent with filtered sets. #216\\n  * Bug fix - If `column.property` is not set, generate key based on column index instead.\\n\\n## reactabular-resizable\\n\\n  * Breaking - Drop `styles` prop. Use `props` instead.\\n\\n## reactabular-sort\\n\\n  * Breaking - Drop `styles` prop. Use `props` instead.\\n\\n## reactabular-table\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow table body and body row `shouldComponentUpdate` to be overridden.\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Breaking - Merge `tree.flatten` with `tree.unpack`. The new signature for `tree.unpack` is `tree.unpack = ({ parentField = 'parent', parent, idField = 'id'}) => (rows) => <unpackedRows>`.\\n  * Breaking - Rework API so that all functions except `tree.toggleChildren` work in curry format (`(...) => (rows) => <new rows>`). This way the API is consistent and easy to extend.\\n  * Breaking - Expose `childrenField` for `tree.pack` and `tree.unpack`. It defaults to `children`.\\n  * Breaking - Make `tree.pack` to work in a recursive manner (packs children within children).\\n  * Breaking - Make `tree.search` match against children as well. If children as matched, it will return parents as well.\\n  * Feature - Add `tree.getChildren` utilities for getting node children.\\n\\n## reactabular-virtualized\\n\\n  * Feature - Add `scrollTo(index)` method to `Virtualized.Body` `ref`.\\n\\n5.3.0 / 2016-10-05\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Feature - Expose `props` prop for customizing `props` of the component. This will replace `styles` eventually.\\n\\n## reactabular-resizable\\n\\n  * Feature - Expose `props` prop for customizing `props` of the component. This will replace `styles` eventually.\\n\\n## reactabular-sort\\n\\n  * Feature - Expose `props` prop for customizing `sort.header` `props` of the component. This will replace `styles` eventually.\\n\\n5.2.1 / 2016-09-30\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Bug fix - If `className` is not provided to `tree.toggleChildren`, do not render `undefined` as a class. Also dropped extra `console.log`.\\n\\n5.2.0 / 2016-09-30\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Calculate `tree.getParents` correctly for root level nodes without parents. Previously that gave false positives.\\n  * Feature - Annotate `tree.toggleChildren` with `has-children` and `has-parent` classes. Easier to style this way.\\n\\n5.1.0 / 2016-09-29\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Feature - Add `tree.flatten` to allow transforming a nested tree structure into a flat structure used by the algorithms.\\n\\n5.0.2 / 2016-09-28\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-virtualized\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Skip `setState` on `componentWillReceiveProps` if no rows were calculated. #209\\n\\n5.0.1 / 2016-09-28\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Bug fix - If there are no draggable headers, do *not* inject `dnd.Header`. This means you don't need to set up React DnD if you aren't using drag and drop functionality. #209\\n\\n5.0.0 / 2016-09-28\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Breaking - Push children toggle behavior to `onToggleShowingChildren` prop. See the readme for a sample implementation. This makes the implementation more flexible. You can trigger `reactabular-tree` `collapseAll` and `expandAll` over `showingChildren` for instance.\\n\\n4.3.0 / 2016-09-27\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Feature - Let `toggleChildren` toggle when cell is clicked. If you want the old behavior, override `onClick` through `props`.\\n  * Feature - Add `collapseAll` and `expandAll` helpers.\\n\\n4.2.0 / 2016-09-23\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Feature - Accept `toggleChildrenProps` for customization.\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow `toggleChildren` to accept `props` for customization.\\n\\n4.1.0 / 2016-09-20\\n==================\\n\\n## react-edit\\n\\n  * Feature - Pass `extraParameters` to `edit` interface. #201\\n\\n## reactabular-sort\\n\\n  * Feature - Add `sort.byColumnsPrioritizeLastSorted`. #199\\n\\n4.0.0 / 2016-09-12\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Breaking - Push `onDragColumn` control to user. Earlier it managed widths through CSS (more performant, but also more brittle). The problem with that was that the initial update of a stylesheet could fail (no widths were set). Now widths are controlled by React completely. Note that the API changed to `onDragColumn(width, { columnIndex })`.\\n\\n3.0.6 / 2016-09-12\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-table\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow `BodyRow` `shouldComponentUpdate` to be overridden by setting `components.body.row.shouldComponentUpdate = true`.\\n\\n## reactabular-virtualized\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Rework initial measurement so that it works with CSS solutions like Radium.\\n\\n3.0.5 / 2016-09-02\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow `id` to be passed to `filter`.\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Pass `rowKey` to `tree.filter`. This way it filters correctly with arbitrary ids.\\n\\n3.0.4 / 2016-09-02\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow `toggleChildren` `id` to be customized (not just \\\"id\\\" anymore).\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Pass `rowKey` to `tree.toggleChildren`. This way toggling can work with arbitrary ids.\\n\\n3.0.3 / 2016-09-01\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Drop redundant `console.log`.\\n\\n3.0.2 / 2016-09-01\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-virtualized\\n\\n  * Feature - Push development logging behind `window.LOG_VIRTUALIZED`.\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Feature - Include suggested default styling for the toggle arrow.\\n\\n3.0.1 / 2016-09-01\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-virtualized\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Keep header and body in sync when scrolling at header.\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Pass `strategy` to `sorter` at `tree.sort`.\\n\\n3.0.0 / 2016-09-01\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-virtualized\\n\\n  * Feature - New standalone package. Virtualization provides a nice performance increase for large datasets. The package works in tandem with reactabular-sticky.\\n\\n## reactabular-table\\n\\n  * Breaking - `onRow` accepts `row, { rowIndex, rowKey }` instead of `row, rowIndex`.\\n  * Feature - If a row contains `_index`, use that as a `rowIndex`. This allows custom indexing (useful for virtualization).\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Feature - Integrate virtualization for extra performance.\\n  * Feature - Integrate `reactabular-tree`. Now it works with tree style data. You should set `cell.toggleChildren: true` to show the UI control for toggling row children visibility.\\n\\n## reactabular-resizable\\n\\n  * Feature - Expose `parent` prop (defaults to `document`). This is handy if you use an iframe and need something more custom.\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Breaking - Rewrite API. Now most parts accept objects and you can also customize field names.\\n  * Feature - Add `tree.sort` to wrap toggling row children.\\n\\n## reactabular-sticky\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Make sure `scrollOffset` gets a value no matter what. This avoid a React warning.\\n\\n## reactabular-utils\\n\\n  * Add `resolveRowKey`.\\n\\n2.0.5 / 2016-08-26\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-sort\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Make sure `sort.byColumns` does not mutate passed `sortingColumns`. Now it performs a deep clone using lodash.\\n\\n## reactabular-sticky\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow `onScroll` handler to be defined for `Body`. Previously it overrode that.\\n\\n## reactabular-table\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow `Body` `rowKey` to be defined as a function (`({ rowData, rowIndex }) => {... return a rowKey ...}`). #193\\n\\n2.0.4 / 2016-08-24\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-sticky\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Calculate extra padding to table body so that header and body widths match even if a scrollbar is visible.\\n\\n2.0.3 / 2016-08-22\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Feature - If an empty column definition is provided, escape early and avoid showing a warning per row.\\n\\n2.0.2 / 2016-08-17\\n==================\\n\\n## react-edit\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow value rendering to be customized. Now you can pass a custom renderer for value if the default (no visible value!) isn't enough.\\n\\n## reactabular-resolve\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Make sure `resolve` does not crash if `rows` aren't provided. It will return an empty array in that case.\\n\\n2.0.1 / 2016-08-16\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - Generate a proper ES6 build for each package. This time it transpiles ES6 features too unlike before. The problem was that Babel didn't transpile object rest spread within ES6 classes correctly. This means ES6 -> ES5 transformation needs to be performed. Not ideal, but this works.\\n\\n2.0.0 / 2016-08-16\\n==================\\n\\n  * Breaking - Push `property` to root level of a column over cell. The new style is often terser.\\n  * Feature - Generate a proper ES6 build for each package. Now they should work with systems like webpack 2 without problems. #189\\n\\n## react-edit\\n\\n  * Breaking - Rename as `react-edit` given it's a generic component. It's not distributed as a part of `reactabular` anymore and you'll have to install it separately. #176.\\n  * Breaking - Auto focus `input` by default. #180.\\n\\n## reactabular-table\\n\\n  * Feature - Improve performance by pushing `onRow` check lower in the component hierarchy.\\n\\n## reactabular-search-field\\n\\n  * Breaking - Override `query` `onChange` instead of patching.\\n  * Breaking - Make it possible to pass `column` as a prop. You should manage its state now. #182\\n  * Feature - Add `onColumnChange` hook. This is needed for tracking `column` state.\\n  * Bug fix - Make search input controlled by default.\\n\\n## reactabular-sort\\n\\n  * Breaking - Return sorting columns if no selected column is passed.\\n  * Breaking - Extract header styling to a separate file (`style.css` at package root) and allow `style` prop to be passed.\\n  * Breaking - Port sorting to a property based scheme over index one.\\n  * Feature - Mark React as a peer dependency.\\n  * Feature - Allow sorting `fieldName` to be customized for `sort`, `header`, and `reset`. This is useful if you want to sort per `property` for example.\\n  * Feature - Allow `sorter` `getColumns` mechanism to be customized. This is needed to make `fieldName` useful.\\n\\n## reactabular-resizable\\n\\n  * Breaking - Extract header styling to a separate file (`style.css` at package root) and allow `style` prop to be passed.\\n  * Feature - Document how to offset the widget.\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Breaking - Push `sortingColumns` to a prop. You should control its state yourself.\\n  * Feature - Add suggested default styling (`style.css` at package root).\\n  * Feature - Allow `classNames` and `styles` props to be passed for styling.\\n  * Bug fix - Force update after mounting. This is needed for the sticky ref scheme to work.\\n\\n## reactabular-resolve\\n\\n  * Breaking - Rework `resolve` interface to be object based and pass row index through it.\\n  * Feature - Implement `resolve.index`. This attached the row indices to `_index`. That can be handy data to have for optimization.\\n\\n## reactabular-visibility-toggles\\n\\n  * Feature - New standalone package of its own. #183\\n\\n## reactabular-dnd\\n\\n  * Feature - New standalone package of its own for wrapping drag and drop related concerns.\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Feature - New standalone package of its own for tree helpers. #168\\n\\n1.2.6 / 2016-08-11\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - select - Drop direct dependency on Reactabular.\\n  * Feature - easy - Expose `components`. Now you can override default components just like for a regular `Table.Provider`. Only exception is `header.cell` given drag and drop needs to override that in order to work.\\n  * Feature - easy - Make `selectedRowIdField` prop optional. It worked before due to the default value, but it's neater this way.\\n\\n1.2.5 / 2016-08-08\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - search-field - Accept `query` as a prop now. Better for persistency.\\n\\n1.2.4 / 2016-08-08\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - search-columns - Rewrite as a stateless function. You should pass `query` as a prop now.\\n\\n1.2.3 / 2016-08-08\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - reactabular - New `search-columns` module for searching per column (UI).\\n  * Feature - reactabular - New `search-field` module for searching (UI).\\n  * Feature - table - Make `rowKey` propType check compatible with React 15.3. It should give you better output during development now.\\n  * Feature - easy - Expose `headerExtra` prop. It can be used to inject extra rows to a header. This works well with `reactabular-search-columns`.\\n  * Feature - easy - Expose `onSort` and `sortingColumns` props. These are useful for implementing sorting persistency.\\n\\n1.2.2 / 2016-08-07\\n==================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - resizable - Fix README example as Sticky API has been simplified (no need for ReactDOM anymore).\\n\\n1.2.1 / 2016-08-05\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - edit - Expose `event` to `onActivate`.\\n  * Feature - easy - Push `reactabular` and `reactabular-utils` as peer dependencies. This way you have better control over which versions to consume at your project.\\n\\n1.2.0 / 2016-08-05\\n==================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - table - Pass unresolved values to `Table.Body` transforms instead of resolved ones.\\n\\n1.1.6 / 2016-08-05\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - edit - Allow `activateEvent` (default `onClick`) to be overridden.\\n  * Feature - easy - Trigger `onMoveColumns` only after moving columns has finished.\\n  * Feature - easy - Expose `selectedRowId`. It defaults to `id`, but if your selection logic relies on some other field, you can change it now.\\n  * Feature - reactabular - New `select` module for handling row selections.\\n\\n1.1.5 / 2016-08-04\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - Attach `NODE_ENV` checks to `propTypes`. Smaller size for production usage.\\n\\n1.1.4 / 2016-08-04\\n==================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - sort - Do not crash if column `cell` definition is missing. #178\\n\\n1.1.3 / 2016-08-04\\n==================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - easy - If a header is set both `sortable` and `resizable`, allow custom formatter to used still.\\n\\n1.1.2 / 2016-08-04\\n==================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - sticky - Fix `reactabular-table` import. Missing `* as`.\\n\\n1.1.1 / 2016-08-04\\n==================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - sticky - Fix `reactabular-table` import. It points to the correct package now.\\n  * Feature - table - Drop `lodash/omit` dependency.\\n\\n1.1.0 / 2016-08-03\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - edit - Allow `editingProps` (`value`/`onValue`) to be overridden.\\n  * Feature - table - Added `getRef` for getting references to underlying DOM elements.\\n  * Feature - sticky - Added `getRef` for getting references to underlying DOM elements.\\n  * Feature - sticky - Moved `reactabular-table` as a peer dependency as I realized it's better to let the user decide which version of the table to use.\\n  * Feature - easy - Dropped dependency on react-dom.\\n\\n1.0.11 / 2016-07-29\\n===================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - sort - `sort.reset` accepts object properly now. Earlier it bailed out too early.\\n  * Feature - Add sorting numbers to the header so you know in which order sorting rules are applied.\\n  * Feature - Allow column sorting status to be reset by doubleclicking on a column header.\\n\\n1.0.10 / 2016-07-29\\n===================\\n\\n  * Feature - sort - `sort.sort` accepts `event` parameter now. It defaults to `onClick`.\\n  * Feature - sort - `sort.reset` is a new transform that can be used to remove the given column from the sorting rules.\\n  * Feature - sort - `sort.header` is a new formatter that can be used to apply sorting. This is handy if you use `sort.reset`.\\n\\n1.0.8 / 2016-07-27\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - easy - Make `tableWidth` and `tableHeight` checks looser.\\n\\n1.0.6 / 2016-07-27\\n==================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - easy - Merge column definition `props.className` correctly. Previously it discarded possible value.\\n  * Feature - easy - Add styling hooks. Now you can attach classes to the table structure (table, thead, tbody).\\n  * Feature - easy - Add `onDragColumn` and `onMoveColumns` hooks.\\n\\n1.0.5 / 2016-07-27\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - highlight - Do not pass `undefined` keys to `_highlights` data.\\n  * Feature - easy - Add column visibility to the example.\\n  * Feature - easy - Render `EasyTable` in a fixed viewport.\\n  * Bug fix - easy - Do not re-initialize styles if columns change. Without this CSS resets. I may have to revisit this decision but it seems logical now.\\n  * Feature - easy - Support `draggable` header flag.\\n\\n1.0.3 / 2016-07-27\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - sticky - Make `tableHeader` prop check looser.\\n  * Feature - easy - Resolve nested and `cell.resolve` based data.\\n  * Feature - easy - Support search with highlighting through a `query` prop.\\n\\n1.0.2 / 2016-07-26\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - resizable - New module for resizing columns.\\n  * Feature - sticky - New pair of components (`Sticky.Header`, `Sticky.Body`) that allow you to render data within a fixed viewport.\\n\\n1.0.1 / 2016-07-26\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - resolve - Make sure `undefined` keys aren't included in the resolved result.\\n  * Bug fix - highlight - Retain original data while highlighting rows.\\n\\n1.0.0 / 2016-07-25\\n==================\\n\\n  * Complete rewrite. Too many changes to mention. Please study the documentation for details.\\n\\n0.14.2 / 2016-06-13\\n===================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Fix `postinstall` script for Node 0.10. #147 @Gudahtt\\n\\n0.14.1 / 2016-06-11\\n===================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Use a ref at `input` editor over `this.getDOMNode()` given latter was deprecated in React 15.\\n\\n0.14.0 / 2016-06-09\\n===================\\n\\n  * Breaking - Force `rowKey` to be set.

He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. \"What\\'s happened to me?\" he thought. It wasn\\'t a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.

You have additional control over here as you can attach for example classes or table row specific hooks if you have to.\\n\\nMost of the power of Reactabular is within the column definition. You can embed React code within it to customize the table further. And if that's not enough, you have decent control over the table layout when rendering.\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/raw-loader!./docs/table/introduction.md\n// module id = 1467\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"Reactabular provides three components: `Table.Provider`, `Table.Header`, and `Table.Body`. `Table.Provider` sets the data context. It may contain multiple `Table.Header` and `Table.Body` elements. You can control data per body while the provider maintains a shared column definition.\\n\\n## `Table.Provider`\\n\\n`Table.Provider` is the core of Reactabular. It sets up a [context](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html) and maps the `column` definition to its children components. The following example illustrates the basic idea.\\n\\n```jsx\\n/*\\nimport { Table } from 'reactabular';\\n*/\\n\\nconst rows = [\\n  {\\n    id: 100,\\n    name: 'Adam',\\n    dad: 'John',\\n    lovesBeeGees: true\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 101,\\n    name: 'Brian',\\n    dad: 'George',\\n    lovesBeeGees: false\\n  },\\n];\\n\\nconst columns = [\\n  {\\n    property: 'name',\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'Name'\\n    }\\n  },\\n  {\\n    property: 'dad',\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'Dad'\\n    }\\n  }\\n];\\n\\n<Table.Provider\\n  className=\\\"pure-table pure-table-striped\\\"\\n  columns={columns}\\n>\\n  <Table.Header />\\n\\n  <Table.Body rows={rows} rowKey=\\\"id\\\" />\\n</Table.Provider>\\n```\\n\\n## `Table.Header`\\n\\n`Table.Header` renders a table header within a `Table.Provider` context.\\n\\n```react\\n<Table.Provider\\n  className=\\\"pure-table pure-table-striped\\\"\\n  columns={columns}\\n>\\n  <Table.Header />\\n\\n  <Table.Body rows={rows} rowKey=\\\"id\\\"/>\\n\\n  <Table.Header />\\n</Table.Provider>\\n```\\n\\n## Customizing `Table.Header`\\n\\nIt is possible to customize a header by passing child components to it. This way you can implement filtering per column for instance.\\n\\nHere `search.Columns` injects an additional row for the filter controls. An alternative way to handle it would be to push the problem to the column definition.\\n\\n```react\\n<Table.Provider\\n  className=\\\"pure-table pure-table-striped\\\"\\n  columns={columns}\\n>\\n  <Table.Header>\\n    <search.Columns\\n      query={{}}\\n      columns={columns}\\n      onChange={value => console.log('new value', value)}\\n    />\\n  </Table.Header>\\n\\n  <Table.Body rows={rows} rowKey=\\\"id\\\" />\\n</Table.Provider>\\n```\\n\\n## `Table.Body`\\n\\n`Table.Body` renders table `rows` within a `Table.Provider` context. It accepts either an array of objects or an array of arrays (see the [Excel example](/examples/excel)). In the former case you should define a `rowKey`. This allows React to render in a more performant way.\\n\\nMost often you'll define `rowKey` as a string. An alternative is to define it using a function like this: `rowKey={({ rowData, rowIndex }) => rowData.nested.id}`. This is useful if your key is nested or related to some other data. Another way to avoid this problem is to generate the field using `reactabular-resolve` and then point to that through a string.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```react\\n<Table.Provider\\n  className=\\\"pure-table pure-table-striped\\\"\\n  columns={columns}\\n>\\n  <Table.Header />\\n\\n  <Table.Body rows={rows.filter(r => r.name === 'Adam')} rowKey=\\\"id\\\" />\\n\\n  <Table.Header />\\n\\n  <Table.Body rows={rows.filter(r => r.name === 'Brian')} rowKey=\\\"id\\\" />\\n</Table.Provider>\\n```\\n\\n## Getting Refs\\n\\nSometimes you might need to access the underlying DOM nodes for measuring etc. This can be achieved as follows:\\n\\n```react\\nclass RefTable extends React.Component {\\n  constructor(props) {\\n    super(props);\\n\\n    this.onRow = this.onRow.bind(this);\\n\\n    this.headerRef = null;\\n    this.bodyRef = null;\\n  }\\n  render() {\\n    return (\\n      <Table.Provider columns={columns}>\\n        <Table.Header\\n          ref={header => {\\n            this.headerRef = header && header.getRef();\\n          }}\\n        />\\n        <Table.Body\\n          ref={body => {\\n            this.bodyRef = body && body.getRef();\\n          }}\\n          rows={rows}\\n          rowKey=\\\"id\\\"\\n          onRow={this.onRow}\\n        />\\n      </Table.Provider>\\n    );\\n  }\\n  onRow(row, { rowIndex, rowKey }) {\\n    return {\\n      onClick: () => console.log(this.headerRef, this.bodyRef)\\n    };\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n<RefTable />\\n```\\n\\n## Customizing `Table.Header` and `Table.Body` Rows\\n\\nIt is possible to customize body behavior on a row level. `onRow` prop accepts function `(row, { rowIndex, rowKey }) => ({...})` that allows you to set custom attributes per each row.\\n\\n```react\\nclass CustomTable extends React.Component {\\n  render() {\\n    return (\\n      <Table.Provider\\n        className=\\\"pure-table pure-table-striped\\\"\\n        columns={columns}\\n      >\\n        <Table.Header\\n          onRow={this.onHeaderRow}\\n        />\\n\\n        <Table.Body\\n          rows={rows}\\n          rowKey=\\\"id\\\"\\n          onRow={this.onBodyRow}\\n        />\\n      </Table.Provider>\\n    );\\n  }\\n  onHeaderRow(row, { rowIndex }) {\\n    return {\\n      onClick: () => console.log('clicked header row', row)\\n    };\\n  }\\n  onBodyRow(row, { rowIndex, rowKey }) {\\n    return {\\n      onClick: () => console.log('clicked body row', row)\\n    };\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n<CustomTable />\\n```\\n\\nIt's a good idea to define a possible `row` handler separately to avoid binding per each `render`. If you write the handler inline, it will bind each time `render()` is called and reduce performance slightly.\\n\\n## Customizing `Table` Footer\\n\\nIt is possible to inject a custom footer like this:\\n\\n```react\\n<Table.Provider\\n  className=\\\"pure-table pure-table-striped\\\"\\n  columns={columns}\\n>\\n  <Table.Header />\\n\\n  <Table.Body rows={rows} rowKey=\\\"id\\\" />\\n\\n  <tfoot>\\n    <tr>\\n      <td>Show custom rows here</td>\\n      <td>Show custom rows here</td>\\n    </tr>\\n  </tfoot>\\n</Table.Provider>\\n```\\n\\n## See Also\\n\\n* [Selection](http://reactabular.js.org/#/examples/selection)\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/raw-loader!./packages/reactabular-table/README.md\n// module id = 1469\n// module chunks = 0","\n    var React = require('react');\n    var PageRenderer = require(\"/Users/juhovepsalainen/Projects/github/reactabular/reactabular/node_modules/catalog/lib/components/Page/PageRenderer\");\n    if (PageRenderer.__esModule) {\n      PageRenderer = PageRenderer.default;\n    }\n    module.exports = React.createClass({\n      displayName: 'WrappedPageRenderer',\n      getInitialState: function() {\n        return {content: require(\"!!./../../node_modules/raw-loader/index.js!./styling.md\")};\n      },\n      componentWillMount: function() {\n        var component = this;\n        if (module.hot) {\n          module.hot.accept(\"!!./../../node_modules/raw-loader/index.js!./styling.md\", function() {\n            component.setState({\n              content: require(\"!!./../../node_modules/raw-loader/index.js!./styling.md\")\n            })\n          })\n        }\n      },\n      render: function() {\n        return React.createElement(PageRenderer, {content: this.state.content});\n      }\n    });\n  \n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/table/styling.md\n// module id = 1470\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"Reactabular doesn't force you to style in any particular way.

This should be a string. For example search options are populated based on this.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  header: {\\n    label: 'Name'\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nGiven you might want to attach custom functionality to a header, say sorting on click, it is possible to attach specific *transforms* to the header cell.

We can for instance inject `onClick` handler and perform sorting based on that. If a transform returns `children`, it will override rendering behavior making it possible to implement editors.\\n\\nThe idea of transforms is that they can inject `propTypes` to the current cell (same idea for header and content). In this case we inject `onClick` handler so that sorting works. If a transform returns `children`, it will override rendering behavior. This is useful for transforms like `edit`.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  header: {\\n    label: 'Name',\\n    transforms: [sortable]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo give you a concrete example of overriding, consider the example below:\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  header: {\\n    label: 'Name',\\n    transforms: [\\n      () => ({\\n        children: <span>override to show instead of value</span>\\n      })\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## **`header.formatters = [label => <string|React element>]`**\\n\\nIf manipulating `propTypes` isn't enough, you can `format` the output. This should return something React can display.

Instead of typing out import and the related code, this takes some of that work away. You still have to connect the data processing portion, though.\\n\\n## API\\n\\nThe API provides a **bind** function that merges the given **extensions** together with the provided column definition.\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport * as extensions from 'reactabular-column-extensions';\\n\\n// Or you can cherry-pick\\nimport { bind } from 'sortabular';\\nimport { bind as bindExtensions } from 'sortabular';\\n```\\n\\n### Binding\\n\\n**`extensions.bind([<extension>]) => ([<column>]) => [<adjusted column>]`**\\n\\nThe binder accepts an array of extensions and a column definition. It adjusts the columns based on this information and merges the configuration emitted by extensions top to bottom.\\n\\nAn extension has to be an object like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  match(column) {\\n    // If a column has `demo` property set, evaluate and merge\\n    return column.demo;\\n  },\\n  evaluate(column) {\\n    // Emit a structure to attach to the column definition\\n    return {\\n      demo: true\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n> If you want to implement a custom extension, you can wrap the object to a function and set defaults there.\\n\\n### Extensions\\n\\n**`extensions.draggableHeader({ onMoveColumns: <function> }) => <extension>`**\\n\\n`draggableHeader` injects the configuration expected by `reactabular-dnd` if `header.draggable` is set. You still have to configure the rest, though.\\n\\n**`extensions.highlightCell() => <extension>`**\\n\\n`highlightCell` injects the configuration expected by highlighting functionality from `searchtabular` if `cell.highlight` is set. You have to connect the highlighting logic with your data processing to make this work.\\n\\n**`extensions.resizableHeader({ window, onDragColumnStart, onDragColumn, onDragColumnEnd, props }) => <extension>`**\\n\\n`resizableHeader` injects the configuration required for resizable headers if `header.resizable` is set. It accepts `window` so you can make resizing work in an iframe. Most often you don't need to touch the parameter, though. You should define `onDragColumn(width, { column }` handler and deal with the new width there. `reactabular-resizable` can be useful for that purpose. `props` allow you to inject custom styling/props to `resizable.column`.\\n\\n**`extensions.sortableHeader({ sortingColumns, onSort, props, strategy }) => <extension>`**\\n\\n`sortableHeader` is a light wrapper to `sortabular` that gets injected if `header.sortable` is set. It sets logic and user interface needed for altering sorting state. It also injects sort reset transform. `sortingColumns`, `onSort(sortingColumns)`, `props`, and `strategy` follow `sortabular` interface. `props` allow you to customize styling/props of `sortabular.sort`.\\n\\n**`extensions.toggleChildrenCell({ idField, parentField, onToggleShowingChildren, props, rows }) => <extension>`**\\n\\n`toggleChildrenCell` gets injected if `cell.toggleChildren` is set. It has been designed to work with nested tree data of `treetabular`. It allows you to customize tree `idField` and `parentField`. In addition you have to define what happens when children are toggled using `onToggleShowingChildren(rowIndex)`. If you want to customize `treetabular.toggleChildren`, you can pass `props` to it. The extension also expects you to pass the rows of your application to it.\\n\\n## Column Extension Example\\n\\nThe example below shows how the transformation works.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```jsx\\n/*\\nimport * as extensions from 'reactabular-column-extensions';\\n*/\\n\\nconst columns = [\\n  {\\n    property: 'color',\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'Color',\\n      draggable: true\\n    }\\n  },\\n  {\\n    property: 'name',\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'Name'\\n    },\\n    cell: {\\n      highlight: true\\n    }\\n  }\\n];\\n\\nconst extendedColumns = extensions.bind([\\n  extensions.draggableHeader({\\n    onMoveColumns: () => ({})\\n  }),\\n  extensions.highlightCell()\\n])(columns);\\n\\n<ul>{\\n  (extendedColumns).map((d, i) =>\\n    <li key={`value-${i}`}>{JSON.stringify(d, null, 2)}</li>\\n  )\\n}</ul>\\n```\\n\\n## License\\n\\nMIT.\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/raw-loader!./~/reactabular-column-extensions/README.md\n// module id = 1494\n// module chunks = 0","/* eslint-disable global-require, import/no-unresolved */\nexport default rootPath => ({\n  title: 'Data',\n  pages: [\n    {\n      path: `${rootPath}/resolving`,\n      title: 'Resolving',\n      component: require('table-resolver/README.md')\n    },\n    {\n      path: `${rootPath}/inline-editing`,\n      title: 'Inline Editing',\n      component: require('./inline-editing.md')\n    },\n    {\n      path: `${rootPath}/sorting`,\n      title: 'Sorting',\n      component: require('sortabular/README.md')\n    },\n    {\n      path: `${rootPath}/pagination`,\n      title: 'Pagination',\n      component: require('./pagination.md')\n    },\n    {\n      path: `${rootPath}/tree`,\n      title: 'Tree',\n      component: require('treetabular/README.md')\n    }\n  ]\n});\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./docs/data/index.js","module.exports = \"[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/reactabular/table-resolver.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/reactabular/table-resolver) [![bitHound Score](https://www.bithound.io/github/reactabular/table-resolver/badges/score.svg)](https://www.bithound.io/github/reactabular/table-resolver) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/reactabular/table-resolver/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/reactabular/table-resolver)\\n\\n# table-resolver - Table resolution utilities\\n\\nSometimes your rows might come in a nested format or it might have a representation that maps to the underlying value. A name split to first and last parts is an example of the former. Country code to country mapping is an example of the latter.\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport * as resolve from 'table-resolver';\\n\\n// Or you can cherry-pick\\nimport { nested } from 'table-resolver';\\nimport { nested as resolveNested } from 'table-resolver';\\n```\\n\\n## API\\n\\nThe API consists of two parts: **row resolvers** and **column resolvers**. If you have complex data, use the former. Latter come in handy if you have a nested column definition that needs to be flattened so that it works with a component like Reactabular.\\n\\n## Row Resolvers\\n\\n`table-resolver` uses an iterator that accepts rows and then transforms it using a specific resolver method (or several, if they have been composed into one).\\n\\n### `resolve.resolve`\\n\\n**`({ columns: <columns>, method: <resolver function>, indexKey = '_index' }) => <rows> => <rows>`**\\n\\nThe `resolve` iterator is the heart of this package. It accepts columns and a method. When applied with rows, it will return resolved rows. The method is a function with signature like: `({ column }) => (rowData) => <resolved row>`. In most cases, the `nested` and `byFunction` methods provided in this package (or a composition of them) will be all you need.\\n\\nThe `resolve` iterator automatically injects into every resolved row object a field named `_index` containing the row's index. If `method` is not provided, `_index` is injected to the data automatically.\\n\\nIf your own resolver (e.g. `byFunction`) happens to also output a field named `_index`, it will overwrite the default one. In that case, if you still need the row index, you may wish to pass a different `indexKey` when calling `resolve`.\\n\\n### Method `resolve.nested`\\n\\n**`({ column }) => (rowData) => <resolved row>`**\\n\\nThe `nested` resolver digs rows from a `property: 'name.first'` kind of definition and maps the received value to property name. It replaces the original value with the resolved one. *Note*: instead of defining a path string `property: 'name.first'`, you may provide a custom getter function `property: data => (data.name || {}).first` directly. This may be slightly faster but needs to be done carefully to prevent TypeErrors due to missing values.\\n\\n### Method creator `resolve.byFunction`\\n\\n**`(path: <string>) => ({ column }) => (rowData) => <resolved row>`**\\n\\nThe `byFunction` resolver accepts a path from where to look for a resolving function. It could be `column.cell.resolve` for example and you can use a nested definition for getting it from your column definition.\\n\\nInstead of replacing the original value, `byFunction` generates `_<property>` kind of field to the resulting rows. This sort of implicit rule is useful for other functionality as it can rely on the same convention.\\n\\n## Column Resolvers\\n\\n### `resolve.columnChildren`\\n\\n**`({ columns, childrenField = 'children' }) => <resolved columns>`**\\n\\nAssuming your column definition is nested, this function resolves it to a flat format.\\n\\n### `resolve.headerRows`\\n\\n**`({ columns, childrenField = 'children' }) => <resolved columns>`**\\n\\nIf your column definition is nested, you have to resolve it to header rows. `resolve.headerRows` has been designed exactly for this purpose.\\n\\n## Combining Resolver Methods\\n\\nYou can easily combine resolver methods like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst resolver = resolve.resolve({\\n  columns,\\n  method: ({ rowData, column }) => resolve.byFunction('cell.resolve')({\\n    rowData: resolve.nested({ rowData, column }),\\n    column\\n  })\\n});\\n```\\n\\nor if you are already using Redux:\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport { compose } from 'redux';\\n\\n...\\n\\nconst resolver = resolve.resolve({\\n  columns,\\n  method: (extra) => compose(\\n    resolve.byFunction('cell.resolve')(extra),\\n    resolve.nested(extra)\\n  )\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## Resolution Example\\n\\nThe following example shows how you to resolve nested values.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```jsx\\n/*\\nimport * as resolve from 'table-resolver';\\n*/\\n\\nconst columns = [\\n  {\\n    property: 'color',\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'Color'\\n    }\\n  },\\n  {\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'Name'\\n    },\\n    children: [\\n      {\\n        property: 'name.first',\\n        header: {\\n          label: 'First Name'\\n        }\\n      },\\n      {\\n        property: 'name.last',\\n        header: {\\n          label: 'Last Name'\\n        }\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  },\\n  {\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'About'\\n    },\\n    children: [\\n      {\\n        property: 'company',\\n        header: {\\n          label: 'Company'\\n        }\\n      },\\n      {\\n        property: 'sentence',\\n        header: {\\n          label: 'Sentence'\\n        }\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n];\\n\\nconst rows = [\\n  {\\n    id: 1,\\n    color: 'red',\\n    name: {\\n      first: 'John',\\n      last: 'Johnson'\\n    },\\n    company: 'John Inc.',\\n    sentence: 'consequatur nihil minima corporis omnis nihil rem'\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 2,\\n    color: 'blue',\\n    name: {\\n      first: 'Mike',\\n      last: 'Mikeson'\\n    },\\n    company: 'Mike Inc.',\\n    sentence: 'a sequi doloremque sed id quo voluptatem voluptatem ut voluptatibus'\\n  }\\n];\\n\\n<ul>{\\n  resolve.resolve(\\n    {\\n      columns: resolve.columnChildren({ columns }),\\n      method: resolve.nested\\n    }\\n  )(rows).map((d, i) =>\\n    <li key={`value-${i}`}>{JSON.stringify(d, null, 2)}</li>\\n  )\\n}</ul>\\n```\\n\\n## License\\n\\nMIT.

These can be combined together to set up sort in various ways. There's control over the algorithm used as well as how it's bound to the user interface. You can also control how sorting is tracked (per column index or per property).\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport * as sort from 'sortabular';\\n\\n// Or you can cherry-pick\\nimport { byColumn } from 'sortabular';\\nimport { byColumn as sortByColumn } from 'sortabular';\\n```\\n\\n### Helpers\\n\\n**`sort.byColumn({ sortingColumns: <sorting columns>, sortingOrder: {FIRST: <string>, <string>: <string>}, selectedColumn: <string> }) => <sorting colums> || {}`**\\n\\n`sort.byColumn` allows you to sort per one column. It discards possible existing sorting state. If you are trying to sort the same column, it will cycle between ascending, descending, and no sorting. In case you are trying to sort some other column, it will start from the ascending state while discarding the existing sorting state.\\n\\n**`sort.byColumns({ sortingColumns: <sorting columns>, sortingOrder: {FIRST: <string>, <string>: <string>}, selectedColumn: <string> }) => <sorting columns> || {}`**\\n\\n`sort.byColumns` is like `sort.byColumn` except it doesn't discard possible existing sort state and instead accumulates it. This allows you to perform sorting over multiple columns while refining the results. The last-sorted column always has the highest `position` value, i.e. the lowest sorting priority.\\n\\n**`sort.byColumnsPrioritizeLastSorted({ sortingColumns: <sorting columns>, sortingOrder: {FIRST: <string>, <string>: <string>}, selectedColumn: <string> }) => <sorting columns> || {}`**\\n\\n`sort.byColumnsPrioritizeLastSorted` is like `sort.byColumns` except it\\nalways gives the last-sorted column the highest sorting priority.\\n\\n**`sort.sorter({ columns: [<object>], sortingColumns: <sorting columns>, sort: <function>, strategy = strategies.byIndex })([<rows to sort>]) => [<sorted rows>]`**\\n\\n`sort.sorter` sorts the passed `rows` using a `sortingColumns` definitions and a `sort` function. It has been designed to work based on [lodash.orderBy](https://lodash.com/docs#orderBy) signature.\\n\\nIf you want to evaluate columns in a reverse order instead of the default, you can reverse `sort` function like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst reverseSort = (data, columnIndexList, orderList) => (\\n  orderBy(data, columnIndexList.slice().reverse(), orderList.slice().reverse())\\n);\\n```\\n\\n### Transforms\\n\\n**`sort.sort = ({ event = 'onClick', getSortingColumns = () => [], strategy = strategies.byIndex, onSort = (columnIndex) => {} } = {}) => (value, { columnIndex }, props)`**\\n\\n`sort.sort` can be applied as a transform. It expects `getSortingColumns` and `onSort` callbacks. The former should return the sorting column data, the latter is called when the user sorts based on `event`.\\n\\n**`sort.reset = ({ event = 'onDoubleClick', getSortingColumns = () => [], strategy = strategies.byIndex, onReset = (columnIndex) => {} } = {}) => (value, { columnIndex }, props)`**\\n\\n`sort.reset` can be applied as a transform. It expects `getSortingColumns` and `onReset` callbacks. The former should return the sorting column data, the latter is called when the user sorts based on `event`.\\n\\n### Formatters\\n\\n**`sort.header = ({ sortable, strategy = strategies.byIndex, getSortingColumns = () => [] }) => (value, { columnIndex })`**\\n\\n`sort.header` can be used to sort within a header cell. This works will with `sort.reset` since then you can apply both reseting and sorting to the same cell without conflicts. It expects an initialized sortable (i.e., `sort.sort`) and `getSortingColumns`. If sorting is active at a column, it displays the current order number.\\n\\n`sortable` and `strategy` parameters are optional. `getSortingColumns` is required.\\n\\nYou can customize `props` of `sort.header` specific portions through the following protocol:\\n\\n```javascript\\nprops = {\\n  container: {},\\n  value: {},\\n  order: {}\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**`sort.order = ({ strategy = strategies.byIndex, getSortingColumns = () => [] }) => (value, { columnIndex })`**\\n\\n`sort.order` can be used to display a sorting arrow widget. It figures out the class name based on the current sorting status. `sort.header` uses this internally.\\n\\n### Strategies\\n\\nMost of the functions accept a strategy. This allows you to modify their sorting behavior. By default they'll track sorting by column index. It's possible to change it to sort by property.\\n\\n**`sort.strategies.byIndex`**\\n\\n`byIndex` is the default strategy used by other functions. It literally means the system will track sorting per index.\\n\\n**`sort.strategies.byProperty`**\\n\\n`byProperty` ties sorting state to column property. This can be useful if you want to retain the sorting state within a column while moving it around.\\n\\n## Sorting Protocol\\n\\nSorting relies on a structure like this to describe what is being sorted and in what order:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst sortingColumns = {\\n  0: {\\n    direction: 'asc',\\n    position: 1\\n  },\\n  1: {\\n    direction: 'desc',\\n    position: 0\\n  }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nIt maps column index to sorting state and can contain multiple sorters.\\n\\n## Customizing Sorting Order\\n\\nIt is possible to customize the sorting order of `sort.byColumn` and `sort.byColumns` by passing an object describing the sorting. It should contain `FIRST` key to describe the starting point. The remaining key-value pairs should form a cycle.\\n\\nAssuming you are using the `sort` transform, the order values are used for generating the classes you see at the user interface.\\n\\nThe default order cycles between `asc`, `desc`, and `''` (no sort).\\n\\nYou could implement a custom order cycling between `asc` and `desc` like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst sortingOrder = {\\n  FIRST: 'asc',\\n  asc: 'desc',\\n  desc: 'asc'\\n};\\n```\\n\\n## The `sort` Transform\\n\\nThe `sort` transform has been designed to track when the user requests sorting and render possibly matching sorting condition as a class for styling. In addition you will need to use specific sort helpers to handle the sorting logic. The helpers have been encapsulated within the `sort` module.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```javascript\\n...\\nimport * as sort from 'sortabular';\\n\\n...\\n\\nconst sortable = sort.sort({\\n  // Point the transform to your rows. React state can work for this purpose\\n  // but you can use a state manager as well.\\n  getSortingColumns: () => this.state.sortingColumns || [],\\n\\n  // The user requested sorting, adjust the sorting state accordingly.\\n  // This is a good chance to pass the request through a sorter.\\n  onSort: selectedColumn => {\\n    this.setState({\\n      sortingColumns: sort.byColumns({ // sort.byColumn would work too\\n        sortingColumns: this.state.sortingColumns,\\n        selectedColumn\\n      })\\n    });\\n  }\\n});\\n\\n...\\n\\n// Mark a header as sortable\\ncolumns: [\\n  {\\n    property: 'name',\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'name',\\n      transforms: [sortable]\\n    }\\n  }\\n]\\n```\\n\\n## How to Use?\\n\\nThe general workflow goes as follows:\\n\\n1. Set up the `sort` transform. Its purpose is to track when the user requests sorting and render possibly matching sorting condition as a class for styling.\\n2. Set up a sort helper. There are helpers for sorting per one column (`sort.byColumn`) and one for sorting per multiple columns (`sort.byColumns`). The helpers handle managing sorting conditions and actual sorting. If you have a back-end, you can skip the latter.\\n3. Sort the rows before rendering.\\n4. Feed the sorted rows to a `Table`.\\n\\n> You can find suggested default styling for the package at `style.css` in the package root.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```jsx\\n/*\\nimport React from 'react';\\nimport orderBy from 'lodash/orderBy';\\nimport * as resolve from 'table-resolver';\\nimport * as Table from 'reactabular-table';\\nimport * as sort from 'sortabular';\\nimport { compose } from 'redux';\\n*/\\n\\nconst initialRows = [\\n  {\\n    id: 100,\\n    name: {\\n      first: 'Adam',\\n      last: 'West'\\n    },\\n    age: 10\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 101,\\n    name: {\\n      first: 'Brian',\\n      last: 'Eno'\\n    },\\n    age: 43\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 102,\\n    name: {\\n      first: 'Brian',\\n      last: 'Wilson'\\n    },\\n    age: 23\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 103,\\n    name: {\\n      first: 'Jake',\\n      last: 'Dalton'\\n    },\\n    age: 33\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 104,\\n    name: {\\n      first: 'Jill',\\n      last: 'Jackson'\\n    },\\n    age: 63\\n  }\\n];\\n\\nclass SortTable extends React.Component {\\n  constructor(props) {\\n    super(props);\\n\\n    const getSortingColumns = () => this.state.sortingColumns || {};\\n    const sortable = sort.sort({\\n      // Point the transform to your rows.

It allows you to set up collapsible rows that can contain more collapsible ones while remaining within a table format.\\n\\nTo achieve this, `treetabular` relies on a flat structure that contains the hierarchy:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst tree = [\\n  {\\n    id: 123,\\n    name: 'Demo'\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 456,\\n    name: 'Another',\\n    parent: 123\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 789,\\n    name: 'Yet Another',\\n    parent: 123\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 532,\\n    name: 'Foobar'\\n  }\\n];\\n```\\n\\nIf there's a `parent` relation, the children must follow their parent right after it (you might use `fixOrder` helper function if your data does not meet that criteria).\\n\\n> You can find suggested default styling for the package at `style.css` in the package root.\\n\\n## API\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport * as tree from 'treetabular';\\n\\n// Or you can cherry-pick\\nimport { filter } from 'treetabular';\\nimport { filter as filterTree } from 'treetabular';\\n```\\n\\n### Transformations\\n\\n**`tree.collapseAll = ({ property = 'showingChildren' }) => (rows) => [<collapsedRow>]`**\\n\\nCollapses rows by setting `showingChildren` of each row to `false`.\\n\\n**`tree.expandAll = ({ property = 'showingChildren' }) => (rows) => [<expandedRow>]`**\\n\\nExpands rows by setting `showingChildren` of each row to `true`.\\n\\n**`tree.filter = ({ fieldName, idField = 'id', parentField = 'parent' }) => (rows) => [<filteredRow>]`**\\n\\nFilters the given rows using `fieldName`. This is handy if you want only rows that are visible assuming visibility logic has been defined.\\n\\n### Queries\\n\\n**`tree.getLevel = ({ index, idField = 'parentId', parentField = 'parent' }) => (rows) => <level>`**\\n\\nReturns the nesting level of the row at the given `index` within `rows`.\\n\\n**`tree.getChildren = ({ index, idField = 'id', parentField = 'parent' }) => (rows) => [<child>]`**\\n\\nReturns children based on given `rows` and `index`. This includes children of children.\\n\\n**`tree.getImmediateChildren = ({ index, idField = 'id', parentField = 'parent' }) => (rows) => [<child>]`**\\n\\nReturns immediate children based on given `rows` and `index`.\\n\\n**`tree.getParents = ({ index, idField = 'parentId', parentField = 'parent' }) => (rows) => [<parent>]`**\\n\\nReturns parents based on given `rows` and `index`.\\n\\n**`tree.hasChildren = ({ index, idField = 'id', parentField = 'parent '}) => (rows) => <boolean>`**\\n\\nReturns a boolean based on whether or not the row at the given `index` has children.\\n\\n**`tree.search = ({ operation: (rows) => [<row>], idField = 'id', parentField = 'parent' }) => (rows) => [<searchedRow>]`**\\n\\nSearches against a tree structure using `operation` while matching against children too. If children are found, associated parents are returned as well. This has been designed to [searchtabular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/searchtabular) `multipleColumns` and `singleColumn`, but as long as the passed operation follows the interface, it should fit in.\\n\\n> This depends on [resolve.resolve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/table-resolver#resolveresolve)!\\n\\n**`tree.wrap = ({ operations: [rows => rows], idField = 'id' }) => (rows) => [<operatedRow>]`**\\n\\nIf you want to perform an operation, such as sorting, against the root rows of a tree, use `tree.wrap`.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```javascript\\nwrap({\\n  operations: [\\n    sorter({\\n      columns,\\n      sortingColumns,\\n      sort: orderBy\\n    })\\n  ]\\n})(rows);\\n```\\n\\n### Packing\\n\\n**`tree.pack = ({ parentField = 'parent', childrenField = 'children', idField = 'id' }) => (rows) => [<packedRow>]`**\\n\\nPacks children inside root level nodes. This is useful with sorting and filtering.\\n\\n**`tree.unpack = ({ parentField = 'parent', childrenField = 'children', idField = 'id', parent }) => (rows) => [<unpackedRow>]`**\\n\\nUnpacks children from root level nodes. This is useful with sorting and filtering.\\n\\n### Drag and Drop\\n\\n**`tree.moveRows = ({ operation: (rows) => [<row>], retain = [], idField = 'id', parentField = 'parent' }) => (rows) => [<movedRow>]`**\\n\\nAllows moving tree rows while `retain`ing given fields at their original rows. You should pass an `operation` that performs actual moving here. [reactabular-dnd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactabular-dnd) `moveRows` is one option.\\n\\n### UI\\n\\n**`tree.toggleChildren = ({ getIndex, getRows, getShowingChildren, toggleShowingChildren, props, idField = 'id', parentField, toggleEvent = 'DoubleClick' }) => (value, extra) => <React element>`**\\n\\nMakes it possible to toggle node children through a user interface.  \\nPass `\\\"indent\\\":false` inside `props` object if you want to disable automatic indentation.\\n\\nThe default implementation of `getIndex(rowData)` depends on [resolve.resolve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/table-resolver#resolveresolve) as it looks for index of the row to toggle based on that. This can be customized through.\\n\\n### Helpers\\n\\n**`tree.fixOrder = ({ parentField = 'parent', idField = 'id' }) => (rows) => [<rows in correct order>]`**\\n\\nIf children in your rows don't follow their parents you can use that helper method so they will be moved into right place.\\n\\nBasically it converts `[ parent, x, y, z, children ]` into `[ parent, children, x, y, z ]`.\\n\\n## Example\\n\\n```jsx\\n/*\\nimport React from 'react';\\nimport cloneDeep from 'lodash/cloneDeep';\\nimport orderBy from 'lodash/orderBy';\\nimport { compose } from 'redux';\\nimport * as resolve from 'table-resolver';\\nimport VisibilityToggles from 'reactabular-visibility-toggles';\\nimport * as Table from 'reactabular-table';\\nimport * as tree from 'treetabular';\\nimport * as search from 'searchtabular';\\nimport * as sort from 'sortabular';\\n\\nimport {\\n  generateParents, generateRows\\n} from './helpers';\\n*/\\n\\nconst schema = {\\n  type: 'object',\\n  properties: {\\n    id: {\\n      type: 'string'\\n    },\\n    name: {\\n      type: 'string'\\n    },\\n    age: {\\n      type: 'integer'\\n    }\\n  },\\n  required: ['id', 'name', 'age']\\n};\\n\\nclass TreeTable extends React.Component {\\n  constructor(props) {\\n    super(props);\\n\\n    const columns = this.getColumns();\\n    const rows = resolve.resolve({ columns })(\\n      generateParents(generateRows(100, schema))\\n    );\\n\\n    this.state = {\\n      searchColumn: 'all',\\n      query: {},\\n      sortingColumns: null,\\n      rows,\\n      columns\\n    };\\n\\n    this.onExpandAll = this.onExpandAll.bind(this);\\n    this.onCollapseAll = this.onCollapseAll.bind(this);\\n    this.onToggleColumn = this.onToggleColumn.bind(this);\\n  }\\n  getColumns() {\\n    const sortable = sort.sort({\\n      // Point the transform to your rows.

It consists of search algorithms that can be applied to the rows. Just like with sorting, you have to apply it to the rows just before rendering. A column is considered searchable in case it has a unique `property` defined.\\n\\n## API\\n\\nThe search API consists of three parts. Out of these `search.multipleColumns` and `search.matches` are the most useful ones for normal usage. If the default search strategies aren't enough, it's possible to implement more as long as you follow the same interface.\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport * as search from 'searchtabular';\\n\\n// Or you can cherry-pick\\nimport { multipleColumns } from 'searchtabular';\\nimport { multipleColumns as searchMultipleColumns } from 'searchtabular';\\n```\\n\\n### Search\\n\\n**`search.multipleColumns({ castingStrategy: <castingStrategy>, columns: [<object>], query: {<column>: <query>}, strategy: <strategy>, transform: <transform> })([<rows to query>]) => [<filtered rows>]`**\\n\\nThis is the highest level search function available. It expects `rows` and `columns` in the same format the `Table` uses. `query` object describes column specific search queries.\\n\\nIt uses `infix` strategy underneath although it is possible to change it. By default it matches in a case **insensitive** manner. If you want case sensitive behavior, pass `a => a`(identity function) as `transform`.\\n\\nIt will cast everything but arrays to a string by default. If you want a custom casting behavior, pass a custom function to `castingStrategy(value, column)`. It should return the cast result.\\n\\n**`search.singleColumn({ castingStrategy: <castingStrategy>, columns: [<object>], searchColumn: <string>, query: <string>, strategy: <strategy>, transform: <transform> })([<rows to query>]) => [<filtered rows>]`**\\n\\nThis is a more specialized version of `search.multipleColumns`. You can use it to search a specific column through `searchColumn` and `query`.\\n\\n### Matchers\\n\\n**`search._columnMatches({ query: <string>, castingStrategy: <castingStrategy>, column: <object>, row: <object>, strategy: <strategy>, transform: <transform> }) => <boolean>`**\\n\\nThis is a function that can be used to figure out all column specific matches. It is meant only for **internal usage** of the library.\\n\\nWhen dealing with strings:\\n\\n**`search.matches({ value: <string>, query: <string>, strategy: <strategy>, transform: <transform> }) => [{ startIndex: <number>, length: <number> }]`**\\n\\nReturns an array with the matches.\\n\\nWhen dealing with arrays:\\n\\n**`search.matches({ value: <string>, query: [<string|[...]>], strategy: <strategy>, transform: <transform> }) => [[{ startIndex: <number>, length: <number> }], ...]`**\\n\\nReturns a sparse array with the same shape as the original query. If there was a match for an item, it will have the same shape as the string version above, otherwise the array will have a hole in that location.\\n\\nThis function returns matches against the given value and query. This is particularly useful with highlighting.\\n\\n### Strategies\\n\\n**`search.strategies.infix(queryTerm: <string>) => { evaluate(searchText: <string>) => <string>, matches(searchText) => [{ startIndex: <number>, length: <number> }]`**\\n\\nSearch uses `infix` strategy by default. This means it will match even if the result is in the middle of a `searchText`.\\n\\nThe strategies operate in two passes - evaluation and matching. The evaluation pass allows us to implement perform fast boolean check on whether or not a search will match. Matching gives exact results.\\n\\n**`search.strategies.prefix(queryTerm: <string>) => { evaluate(searchText: <string>) => <string>, matches(searchText) => [{ startIndex: <number>, length: <number> }]`**\\n\\n`prefix` strategy matches from the start.\\n\\n## Highlighting Search Results\\n\\nTo make it possible to highlight search results per column, there's a specific `highlightCell` formatter.\\n\\n## How to Use?\\n\\nThe general workflow goes as follows:\\n\\n1. Set up a `Search` control that outputs a query in `{<column>: <query>}` format. If `<column>` is `all`, then the search will work against all columns. Otherwise it will respect the exact columns set. You'll most likely want to use either `reactabular-search-field` or `reactabular-search-columns` (or both) for this purpose or provide an implementation of your own if you are not using Reactabular.\\n2. Before rendering the rows, perform `search.multipleColumns({ columns, query })(rows)`. This will filter the rows based on the passed `rows`, `columns` definition, and `query`. A lazy way to do this is to filter at `render()` although you can do it elsewhere too to optimize rendering.\\n3. Pass the filtered rows to `Table`.\\n\\nTo use it, you'll first you have to annotate your rows using `highlighter`. It attaches a structure like this there:\\n\\n```javascript\\n_highlights: {\\n  demo: [{ startIndex: 0, length: 4 }]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```jsx\\n/*\\nimport React from 'react';\\nimport { compose } from 'redux';\\nimport * as Table from 'reactabular-table';\\nimport * as resolve from 'table-resolver';\\nimport * as search from 'searchtabular';\\n*/\\n\\nclass HighlightTable extends React.Component {\\n  constructor(props) {\\n    super(props);\\n\\n    this.state = {\\n      searchColumn: 'all',\\n      query: {},\\n      columns: [\\n        {\\n          header: {\\n            label: 'Name'\\n          },\\n          children: [\\n            {\\n              property: 'name.first',\\n              header: {\\n                label: 'First Name'\\n              },\\n              cell: {\\n                formatters: [search.highlightCell]\\n              }\\n            },\\n            {\\n              property: 'name.last',\\n              header: {\\n                label: 'Last Name'\\n              },\\n              cell: {\\n                formatters: [search.highlightCell]\\n              }\\n            }\\n          ]\\n        },\\n        {\\n          property: 'age',\\n          header: {\\n            label: 'Age'\\n          },\\n          cell: {\\n            formatters: [search.highlightCell]\\n          }\\n        }\\n      ],\\n      rows: [\\n        {\\n          id: 100,\\n          name: {\\n            first: 'Adam',\\n            last: 'West'\\n          },\\n          age: 10\\n        },\\n        {\\n          id: 101,\\n          name: {\\n            first: 'Brian',\\n            last: 'Eno'\\n          },\\n          age: 43\\n        },\\n        {\\n          id: 103,\\n          name: {\\n            first: 'Jake',\\n            last: 'Dalton'\\n          },\\n          age: 33\\n        },\\n        {\\n          id: 104,\\n          name: {\\n            first: 'Jill',\\n            last: 'Jackson'\\n          },\\n          age: 63\\n        }\\n      ]\\n    };\\n  }\\n  render() {\\n    const { searchColumn, columns, rows, query } = this.state;\\n    const resolvedColumns = resolve.columnChildren({ columns });\\n    const resolvedRows = resolve.resolve({\\n      columns: resolvedColumns,\\n      method: resolve.nested\\n    })(rows);\\n    const searchedRows = compose(\\n      search.highlighter({\\n        columns: resolvedColumns,\\n        matches: search.matches,\\n        query\\n      }),\\n      search.multipleColumns({\\n        columns: resolvedColumns,\\n        query\\n      }),\\n    )(resolvedRows);\\n\\n    return (\\n      <div>\\n        <div className=\\\"search-container\\\">\\n          <span>Search</span>\\n          <search.Field\\n            column={searchColumn}\\n            query={query}\\n            columns={resolvedColumns}\\n            rows={resolvedRows}\\n            onColumnChange={searchColumn => this.setState({ searchColumn })}\\n            onChange={query => this.setState({ query })}\\n          />\\n        </div>\\n        <Table.Provider columns={resolvedColumns}>\\n          <Table.Header\\n            headerRows={resolve.headerRows({ columns })}\\n          />\\n\\n          <Table.Body rows={searchedRows} rowKey=\\\"id\\\" />\\n        </Table.Provider>\\n      </div>\\n    );\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n<HighlightTable />\\n```\\n\\n## Components\\n\\n`searchtabular` provides a couple of convenience components listed below.\\n\\n### Searching Columns\\n\\n`searchtabular.Columns` is a single component you can inject within a table header to allow searching per column. It expects `columns` and `onChange` handler. The latter is used to update the search query based on the search protocol.\\n\\n## How to Use?\\n\\nConsider the example below.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```jsx\\n/*\\nimport React from

It provides two functions:\\n\\n* `column({ parent = document, onDrag, minWidth = 10, props: { ... }})`. This formatter does most of the work.\\n* `helper({ globalId, getId })` returns an object with `initialize({ columns, getId: (column, index) => ...})`, `cleanup()`, and `update({ column, width })` methods. The helper can be used with the formatter to implement performant resizing. It utilizes CSS stylesheets for this purpose. It also expects you set `width` per each column at your column definition.\\n\\nNote that the current implementation doesn't constrain the total width of the table. That would require additional logic as you would have to check for this while altering a column width.\\n\\n## How to Use?\\n\\nThe following example adjusts column widths through CSS to keep the performance high while using a sticky header/body.

[This StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/29512692/629578) suggests the configuration below. If this does not work for you, due to other styling constraints or concerns about browser compatibility, you may consider the other answers posted there, or you may need to take care of your column sizing and resizing in JavaScript.\\n\\n```css\\n{\\n  display: flex;\\n  flex-flow: column;\\n\\n  thead,\\n  tbody tr {\\n    display: table;\\n    table-layout: fixed;\\n  }\\n\\n  thead {\\n

Rather than implementing a lot of functionality in its core, it provides extension points. You can, for instance, customize rendering on cell level. It is possible to implement functionality, such as search, pagination, sorting, and inline editing, through composition. The library includes a variety of utilities for this even though you may use third party ones as well.\\n\\nBy default Reactabular operates using a column and a data definition. It doesn't care where those come from. It just renders the table for you. This means Reactabular will fit right into your current data architecture. It doesn't constrain it in any manner.\\n\\nThe chosen approach pushes a lot of complexity out of the core. As a result it might take more code to achieve certain functionalities. This is the price of flexibility. And that's the primary design goal of Reactabular.\\n\\n> If you want to learn more about React, read [SurviveJS - Webpack and React](http://survivejs.com/).\\n\\n## Example\\n\\nThe following example illustrates the approach used by Reactabular:\\n\\n```jsx\\n/*\\nimport * as Table from 'reactabular-table';\\n*/\\n\\nconst rows = [\\n  {\\n    id: 100,\\n    name: 'John',\\n    tools: {\\n      hammer: true\\n    },\\n    country: 'fi'\\n  },\\n  {\\n    id: 101,\\n    name: 'Jack',\\n    tools: {\\n      hammer: false\\n    },\\n    country: 'dk'\\n  }\\n];\\nconst countries = {\\n  fi: 'Finland',\\n  dk: 'Denmark'\\n};\\n\\nconst columns = [\\n  {\\n    property: 'name',\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'Name',\\n      transforms: [\\n        label => ({\\n          onClick: () => alert(`clicked ${label}`)\\n        })\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  },\\n  {\\n    property: 'tools',\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'Active',\\n      transforms: [\\n        label => ({\\n          onClick: () => alert(`clicked ${label}`)\\n        })\\n      ]\\n    },\\n    cell: {\\n      formatters: [\\n        tools => tools.hammer ? 'Hammertime' : 'nope'\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  },\\n  {\\n    property: 'country',\\n    header: {\\n      label: 'Country',\\n      transforms: [\\n        label => ({\\n          onClick: () => alert(`clicked ${label}`)\\n        })\\n      ]\\n    },\\n    cell: {\\n      formatters: [\\n        country => countries[country]\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  },\\n];\\n\\n<Table.Provider\\n  className=\\\"pure-table pure-table-striped\\\"\\n  columns={columns}\\n>\\n  <Table.Header />\\n\\n  <Table.Body rows={rows} rowKey=\\\"id\\\" />\\n</Table.Provider>\\n```\\n\\n## Available Packages\\n\\nThe following image shows roughly what packages are available. You will need to install them individually based on your needs. It is possible to use packages beyond these, but the ones listed below are maintained within the Reactabular organization:\\n\\n![Reactabular packages](./images/overall.png)\\n\\n## Testimonials\\n\\n> If you've struggled with other React table components, you'll see why this one is the best! - [Tim Dorr](https://twitter.com/timdorr/status/750346565374455808)\\n\\n---\\n\\n> It’s not a regular table component it’s a whole framework to work with tables: sorting, drag’n’drop, filtering, etc. And it’s easy to change every part if you need something specific. - [Artem Sapegin](http://sapegin.me/)\\n\\n---\\n\\n> Great work with reactabular!

The biggest changes have to do with the column definition (`formatters [<fn>]` over `format: <fn>`, no support for nested columns out of the box), resolving (composes better), and `reactabular-easy` partitioning (better API for the future).\\n\\n## Reorganization\\n\\n`reactabular` wrapper package has been dropped. As a result no standalone builds are available anymore. This has to do with the fact that the project has been split up into smaller parts that maintaining one didn't make any sense.\\n\\nThis means that in order to use the basic table without any bells and whistles you will have to `import * as Table from 'reactabular-table';` over `import { Table } from 'reactabular';`\\n\\nThe following packages have been moved to standalone projects:\\n\\n  * `reactabular-search` is [searchtabular](https://github.com/reactabular/searchtabular) now.\\n  * `reactabular-tree` is [treetabular](https://github.com/reactabular/treetabular) now.\\n  * `reactabular-resolve` is [table-resolver](https://github.com/reactabular/table-resolver) now.\\n  * `reactabular-highlight` has been integrated to `searchtabular`. You get `search.highlighter`, `search.highlightCell`, and `search.highlightValue` now.\\n  * `reactabular-search-columns` has been integrated to `searchtabular`. You can access it through `search.Columns`.\\n  * `reactabular-search-field` has been integrated to `searchtabular`. You can access it through `search.Field`.\\n  * `reactabular-sort` is [sortabular](https://github.com/reactabular/sortabular) now.\\n  * `reactabular-select` was integrated into [selectabular](https://github.com/reactabular/selectabular). You can access it through `import { byArrowKeys } from 'selectabular';`.\\n  * `react-edit` is functionally the same as before except it is in a repository of its own. This makes it possible to keep its versioning out of sync with the rest as it moves slower.\\n  * `reactabular-visibility-toggles` has been pushed to [react-visibility-toggles](https://github.com/reactabular/react-visibility-toggles) with several improvements and full test coverage.\\n\\n`reactabular-utils` doesn't exist anymore as the functionality has been split up into `reactabular-table` and `table-resolver`.\\n\\n## No More Nested Support Out of the Box\\n\\nReactabular doesn't support nested column definitions out of the box anymore. Earlier they did, but the logic didn't. To fix this, the related resolving pass was moved outside of the core. Even though it's more code, now all the logic (search/sorting/...) works with nested definitions and you have control over naming and the conventions you prefer.\\n\\n  * Breaking - `resizableColumn` isn't included in the core distribution anymore. You should use `reactabular-resizable` instead.\\n  * Breaking - Official support for lodash 3 has been dropped.\\n\\n## reactabular-dnd\\n\\n  * Feature - Expose `dnd.draggableRow`. This allows you to use row dragging with virtualization. Example: `body.row = dnd.draggableRow(Virtualized.BodyRow)`.\\n  * Feature - `dnd.draggableRow` hooks into row level (`onRow({ rowId })`) props `onCanMove({ rowId })`, `onMoveStart({ rowId })`, `onMove({ sourceRowId, targetRowId })`, and `onMoveEnd({ rowId })` instead of just `onMove`.\\n  * Feature - Fail fas if `moveLabels` is missing data.\\n  * Feature - Expose `move` core algorithm. This can be useful standalone.\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Feature - Support row dragging. This has been exposed through `onMoveRow({ sourceRowId, targetRowId })`. You are expected to call an algorithm that actually moves the row there. `reactabular-dnd` implements these. Note that this works only while there is no sorting or search query in place!\\n  * Bug fix - Inject `className` per row only if it has been defined at `onRow`.\\n  * Bug fix - If a column has width set, set `maxWidth` to it as well. #238\\n  * Breaking - The API has been partitioned so that the column definition related functionality is bound separately. This makes it possible to implement nested column functionality on top of it. Consider the example below and see the README for more:\\n\\n```javascript\\n...\\n\\nrender() {\\n  ...\\n\\n  const newColumns = easy.bindColumns({\\n    toggleChildrenProps: { className: 'toggle-children' },\\n    sortingColumns,\\n    rows,\\n    idField,\\n    parentField,\\n    props: this.props,\\n\\n    // Handlers\\n    onMoveColumns: this.onMoveColumns,\\n    onSort: this.onSort,\\n    onDragColumn: this.onDragColumn,\\n    onToggleShowingChildren: this.onToggleShowingChildren\\n  })(columns);\\n\\n  ...\\n}\\n\\n...\\n```\\n\\n## reactabular-table\\n\\n  * Feature - Pass whole column through header/body for extra parameters.\\n  * Feature - Support `onRow` at `Table.Header`.\\n  * Feature - Allow `Table.Header` to accept `headerRows` (an array of column definitions) to override default columns. See below.\\n  * Feature - Move `utils.resolveRowKey`, `utils.evaluateFormatters`, `utils.evaluateTransforms`, `utils.mergeProps`, `utils.columnsAreEqual` to `reactabular-table`.\\n  * Bug fix - Skip functions at `BodyRow` `shouldComponentUpdate`.\\n  * Breaking - Generalize `format: <fn>` as `formatters: [<fn>]`. The formatters are applied recursively from left to right: `[f1, f2, f3] => f1(f2(f3(value, extra)))`. This allows composition.\\n  * Breaking - Extract nested column logic. Now you will have to resolve nested columns before passing them to the table. The advantage of doing this is that now all logic (search/sorting/etc.) works with nested tables. Basic idea:\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport { resolve } from 'reactabular';\\n// or\\n// import * as resolve from 'table-resolver';\\n\\n...\\n\\nconst NestedColumnsTable = () => {\\n  const resolvedColumns = resolve.columnChildren({ columns });\\n  const resolvedRows = resolve.resolve({\\n    columns: resolvedColumns,\\n    method: resolve.nested\\n  })(rows);\\n\\n  return (\\n    <Table.Provider columns={resolvedColumns}>\\n      <Table.Header\\n        headerRows={resolve.headerRows({ columns })}\\n      />\\n\\n      <Table.Body\\n        rows={resolvedRows}\\n        rowKey=\\\"id\\\"\\n      />\\n    </Table.Provider>\\n  );\\n};\\n\\n...\\n```\\n\\n## reactabular-resizable\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow `minWidth` to be set per `column` explicitly.\\n  * Breaking - Push performance optimized resizing to a function. As a result `reactabular-resizable` exposes `column` and `helper` functions now. `column` is the same as before. `helper` implements optional performance optimizations. See the README for usage instructions.\\n\\n## reactabular-virtualized\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Improve horizontal scrolling performance when used with reactabular-sticky. If it detects Y didn't change while scrolling, it skips rendering now.\\n  * Bug fix - Skip functions at `BodyRow` `shouldComponentUpdate`.\\n  * Breaking - Speed up vertical scrolling by implementing `shouldComponentUpdate` for rows. Now it detects whether or not a row has been measured and also does check based on column and row changes like default SCU at reactabular-table.\\n\\n## reactabular-column-extensions\\n\\n  * New package to wrap common configuration.\\n\\n7.0.0 / 2016-11-03\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-dnd\\n\\n  * Breaking - Rework `moveRows` interface. Instead of `moveRows(rows, { sourceRowId, targetRowId }) => rows` it's `moveRows({ rows, sourceRowId, targetRowId }) => rows` now.\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Pass `parentField` to `tree.filter`. Now toggling should work.\\n  * Breaking - Push `onMoveColumns` behavior out of table core. Now it doesn't maintain table state at all. As a result you need to implement `onMoveColumns` handler like this to make column moving work:\\n\\n```javascript\\nonMoveColumns({ columns, source, target }) {\\n  this.setState({ columns });\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## reactabular-select\\n\\n  * Breaking - Push logic to [selectabular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selectabular). See the selection demo (features -> selecting rows) for the new, more powerful API.\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Allow `tree.toggleChildren` to work without column `props` defined.\\n  * Feature - Add `tree.getImmediateChildren`.\\n  * Feature - Add `tree.moveRows`.\\n  * Breaking - Refactor `tree.filter` as `({ fieldName, parentField = 'parent' }) => (rows) => filteredRows`.\\n\\n## reactabular-utils\\n\\n  * Bug fix - If `rowKey` value is zero, `resolveRowKey` should return `0-row`.\\n  * Feature - Allow `colSpan` and `rowSpan` to be overridden at `resolveHeaderRows`.\\n\\n6.1.2 / 2016-10-31\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Fix `onRow` behavior (match interface with `reactabular-table`). #229\\n\\n6.1.1 / 2016-10-27\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-search\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Return `false` if `property` is not defined. #228\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Allow `tree.filter` `parent` to be zero.\\n\\n6.1.0 / 2016-10-25\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Make sure `idField` `prop` works correctly. `tree.sort` needed to receive `idField` for the logic to work.\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow `idField` to be passed to `tree.sort`.\\n\\n6.0.3 / 2016-10-19\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Bump peer version ranges to avoid npm warnings.\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Bump peer version ranges to avoid npm warnings.\\n\\n## reactabular-virtualized\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Bump peer version ranges to avoid npm warnings.\\n\\n6.0.2 / 2016-10-19\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Feature - Add an example showing how to access `scrollTo`.\\n\\n6.0.0 / 2016-10-14\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Breaking - Expose `idField` and `parentField` `props` for customizing tree field types. Earlier `rowKey` handled `idField` but now it has been separated for clarity.\\n  * Breaking - Drop `styles` prop. Use `props` instead.\\n\\n## reactabular-search\\n\\n  * Breaking - `search.multipleColumns` and `search.singleColumn` now accept a `castingStrategy` parameter to define how to cast properties when searching. By default, everything by arrays is cast to a string.\\n  * Feature - `search.matches` now traverses arrays and returns results in the same shape.\\n\\n## reactabular-search-columns\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Make toggling behavior rely on `property` over `id`. Now the behavior is more consistent with filtered sets. #216\\n  * Bug fix - If `column.property` is not set, generate key based on column index instead.\\n\\n## reactabular-resizable\\n\\n  * Breaking - Drop `styles` prop. Use `props` instead.\\n\\n## reactabular-sort\\n\\n  * Breaking - Drop `styles` prop. Use `props` instead.\\n\\n## reactabular-table\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow table body and body row `shouldComponentUpdate` to be overridden.\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Breaking - Merge `tree.flatten` with `tree.unpack`. The new signature for `tree.unpack` is `tree.unpack = ({ parentField = 'parent', parent, idField = 'id'}) => (rows) => <unpackedRows>`.\\n  * Breaking - Rework API so that all functions except `tree.toggleChildren` work in curry format (`(...) => (rows) => <new rows>`). This way the API is consistent and easy to extend.\\n  * Breaking - Expose `childrenField` for `tree.pack` and `tree.unpack`. It defaults to `children`.\\n  * Breaking - Make `tree.pack` to work in a recursive manner (packs children within children).\\n  * Breaking - Make `tree.search` match against children as well. If children as matched, it will return parents as well.\\n  * Feature - Add `tree.getChildren` utilities for getting node children.\\n\\n## reactabular-virtualized\\n\\n  * Feature - Add `scrollTo(index)` method to `Virtualized.Body` `ref`.\\n\\n5.3.0 / 2016-10-05\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Feature - Expose `props` prop for customizing `props` of the component. This will replace `styles` eventually.\\n\\n## reactabular-resizable\\n\\n  * Feature - Expose `props` prop for customizing `props` of the component. This will replace `styles` eventually.\\n\\n## reactabular-sort\\n\\n  * Feature - Expose `props` prop for customizing `sort.header` `props` of the component. This will replace `styles` eventually.\\n\\n5.2.1 / 2016-09-30\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Bug fix - If `className` is not provided to `tree.toggleChildren`, do not render `undefined` as a class. Also dropped extra `console.log`.\\n\\n5.2.0 / 2016-09-30\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Calculate `tree.getParents` correctly for root level nodes without parents. Previously that gave false positives.\\n  * Feature - Annotate `tree.toggleChildren` with `has-children` and `has-parent` classes. Easier to style this way.\\n\\n5.1.0 / 2016-09-29\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Feature - Add `tree.flatten` to allow transforming a nested tree structure into a flat structure used by the algorithms.\\n\\n5.0.2 / 2016-09-28\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-virtualized\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Skip `setState` on `componentWillReceiveProps` if no rows were calculated. #209\\n\\n5.0.1 / 2016-09-28\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Bug fix - If there are no draggable headers, do *not* inject `dnd.Header`. This means you don't need to set up React DnD if you aren't using drag and drop functionality. #209\\n\\n5.0.0 / 2016-09-28\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Breaking - Push children toggle behavior to `onToggleShowingChildren` prop. See the readme for a sample implementation. This makes the implementation more flexible. You can trigger `reactabular-tree` `collapseAll` and `expandAll` over `showingChildren` for instance.\\n\\n4.3.0 / 2016-09-27\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Feature - Let `toggleChildren` toggle when cell is clicked. If you want the old behavior, override `onClick` through `props`.\\n  * Feature - Add `collapseAll` and `expandAll` helpers.\\n\\n4.2.0 / 2016-09-23\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Feature - Accept `toggleChildrenProps` for customization.\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow `toggleChildren` to accept `props` for customization.\\n\\n4.1.0 / 2016-09-20\\n==================\\n\\n## react-edit\\n\\n  * Feature - Pass `extraParameters` to `edit` interface. #201\\n\\n## reactabular-sort\\n\\n  * Feature - Add `sort.byColumnsPrioritizeLastSorted`. #199\\n\\n4.0.0 / 2016-09-12\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Breaking - Push `onDragColumn` control to user. Earlier it managed widths through CSS (more performant, but also more brittle). The problem with that was that the initial update of a stylesheet could fail (no widths were set). Now widths are controlled by React completely. Note that the API changed to `onDragColumn(width, { columnIndex })`.\\n\\n3.0.6 / 2016-09-12\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-table\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow `BodyRow` `shouldComponentUpdate` to be overridden by setting `components.body.row.shouldComponentUpdate = true`.\\n\\n## reactabular-virtualized\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Rework initial measurement so that it works with CSS solutions like Radium.\\n\\n3.0.5 / 2016-09-02\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow `id` to be passed to `filter`.\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Pass `rowKey` to `tree.filter`. This way it filters correctly with arbitrary ids.\\n\\n3.0.4 / 2016-09-02\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow `toggleChildren` `id` to be customized (not just \\\"id\\\" anymore).\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Pass `rowKey` to `tree.toggleChildren`. This way toggling can work with arbitrary ids.\\n\\n3.0.3 / 2016-09-01\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Drop redundant `console.log`.\\n\\n3.0.2 / 2016-09-01\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-virtualized\\n\\n  * Feature - Push development logging behind `window.LOG_VIRTUALIZED`.\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Feature - Include suggested default styling for the toggle arrow.\\n\\n3.0.1 / 2016-09-01\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-virtualized\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Keep header and body in sync when scrolling at header.\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Pass `strategy` to `sorter` at `tree.sort`.\\n\\n3.0.0 / 2016-09-01\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-virtualized\\n\\n  * Feature - New standalone package. Virtualization provides a nice performance increase for large datasets. The package works in tandem with reactabular-sticky.\\n\\n## reactabular-table\\n\\n  * Breaking - `onRow` accepts `row, { rowIndex, rowKey }` instead of `row, rowIndex`.\\n  * Feature - If a row contains `_index`, use that as a `rowIndex`. This allows custom indexing (useful for virtualization).\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Feature - Integrate virtualization for extra performance.\\n  * Feature - Integrate `reactabular-tree`. Now it works with tree style data. You should set `cell.toggleChildren: true` to show the UI control for toggling row children visibility.\\n\\n## reactabular-resizable\\n\\n  * Feature - Expose `parent` prop (defaults to `document`). This is handy if you use an iframe and need something more custom.\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Breaking - Rewrite API. Now most parts accept objects and you can also customize field names.\\n  * Feature - Add `tree.sort` to wrap toggling row children.\\n\\n## reactabular-sticky\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Make sure `scrollOffset` gets a value no matter what. This avoid a React warning.\\n\\n## reactabular-utils\\n\\n  * Add `resolveRowKey`.\\n\\n2.0.5 / 2016-08-26\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-sort\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Make sure `sort.byColumns` does not mutate passed `sortingColumns`. Now it performs a deep clone using lodash.\\n\\n## reactabular-sticky\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow `onScroll` handler to be defined for `Body`. Previously it overrode that.\\n\\n## reactabular-table\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow `Body` `rowKey` to be defined as a function (`({ rowData, rowIndex }) => {... return a rowKey ...}`). #193\\n\\n2.0.4 / 2016-08-24\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-sticky\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Calculate extra padding to table body so that header and body widths match even if a scrollbar is visible.\\n\\n2.0.3 / 2016-08-22\\n==================\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Feature - If an empty column definition is provided, escape early and avoid showing a warning per row.\\n\\n2.0.2 / 2016-08-17\\n==================\\n\\n## react-edit\\n\\n  * Feature - Allow value rendering to be customized. Now you can pass a custom renderer for value if the default (no visible value!) isn't enough.\\n\\n## reactabular-resolve\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Make sure `resolve` does not crash if `rows` aren't provided. It will return an empty array in that case.\\n\\n2.0.1 / 2016-08-16\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - Generate a proper ES6 build for each package. This time it transpiles ES6 features too unlike before. The problem was that Babel didn't transpile object rest spread within ES6 classes correctly. This means ES6 -> ES5 transformation needs to be performed. Not ideal, but this works.\\n\\n2.0.0 / 2016-08-16\\n==================\\n\\n  * Breaking - Push `property` to root level of a column over cell. The new style is often terser.\\n  * Feature - Generate a proper ES6 build for each package. Now they should work with systems like webpack 2 without problems. #189\\n\\n## react-edit\\n\\n  * Breaking - Rename as `react-edit` given it's a generic component. It's not distributed as a part of `reactabular` anymore and you'll have to install it separately. #176.\\n  * Breaking - Auto focus `input` by default. #180.\\n\\n## reactabular-table\\n\\n  * Feature - Improve performance by pushing `onRow` check lower in the component hierarchy.\\n\\n## reactabular-search-field\\n\\n  * Breaking - Override `query` `onChange` instead of patching.\\n  * Breaking - Make it possible to pass `column` as a prop. You should manage its state now. #182\\n  * Feature - Add `onColumnChange` hook. This is needed for tracking `column` state.\\n  * Bug fix - Make search input controlled by default.\\n\\n## reactabular-sort\\n\\n  * Breaking - Return sorting columns if no selected column is passed.\\n  * Breaking - Extract header styling to a separate file (`style.css` at package root) and allow `style` prop to be passed.\\n  * Breaking - Port sorting to a property based scheme over index one.\\n  * Feature - Mark React as a peer dependency.\\n  * Feature - Allow sorting `fieldName` to be customized for `sort`, `header`, and `reset`. This is useful if you want to sort per `property` for example.\\n  * Feature - Allow `sorter` `getColumns` mechanism to be customized. This is needed to make `fieldName` useful.\\n\\n## reactabular-resizable\\n\\n  * Breaking - Extract header styling to a separate file (`style.css` at package root) and allow `style` prop to be passed.\\n  * Feature - Document how to offset the widget.\\n\\n## reactabular-easy\\n\\n  * Breaking - Push `sortingColumns` to a prop. You should control its state yourself.\\n  * Feature - Add suggested default styling (`style.css` at package root).\\n  * Feature - Allow `classNames` and `styles` props to be passed for styling.\\n  * Bug fix - Force update after mounting. This is needed for the sticky ref scheme to work.\\n\\n## reactabular-resolve\\n\\n  * Breaking - Rework `resolve` interface to be object based and pass row index through it.\\n  * Feature - Implement `resolve.index`. This attached the row indices to `_index`. That can be handy data to have for optimization.\\n\\n## reactabular-visibility-toggles\\n\\n  * Feature - New standalone package of its own. #183\\n\\n## reactabular-dnd\\n\\n  * Feature - New standalone package of its own for wrapping drag and drop related concerns.\\n\\n## reactabular-tree\\n\\n  * Feature - New standalone package of its own for tree helpers. #168\\n\\n1.2.6 / 2016-08-11\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - select - Drop direct dependency on Reactabular.\\n  * Feature - easy - Expose `components`. Now you can override default components just like for a regular `Table.Provider`. Only exception is `header.cell` given drag and drop needs to override that in order to work.\\n  * Feature - easy - Make `selectedRowIdField` prop optional. It worked before due to the default value, but it's neater this way.\\n\\n1.2.5 / 2016-08-08\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - search-field - Accept `query` as a prop now. Better for persistency.\\n\\n1.2.4 / 2016-08-08\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - search-columns - Rewrite as a stateless function. You should pass `query` as a prop now.\\n\\n1.2.3 / 2016-08-08\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - reactabular - New `search-columns` module for searching per column (UI).\\n  * Feature - reactabular - New `search-field` module for searching (UI).\\n  * Feature - table - Make `rowKey` propType check compatible with React 15.3. It should give you better output during development now.\\n  * Feature - easy - Expose `headerExtra` prop. It can be used to inject extra rows to a header. This works well with `reactabular-search-columns`.\\n  * Feature - easy - Expose `onSort` and `sortingColumns` props. These are useful for implementing sorting persistency.\\n\\n1.2.2 / 2016-08-07\\n==================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - resizable - Fix README example as Sticky API has been simplified (no need for ReactDOM anymore).\\n\\n1.2.1 / 2016-08-05\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - edit - Expose `event` to `onActivate`.\\n  * Feature - easy - Push `reactabular` and `reactabular-utils` as peer dependencies. This way you have better control over which versions to consume at your project.\\n\\n1.2.0 / 2016-08-05\\n==================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - table - Pass unresolved values to `Table.Body` transforms instead of resolved ones.\\n\\n1.1.6 / 2016-08-05\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - edit - Allow `activateEvent` (default `onClick`) to be overridden.\\n  * Feature - easy - Trigger `onMoveColumns` only after moving columns has finished.\\n  * Feature - easy - Expose `selectedRowId`. It defaults to `id`, but if your selection logic relies on some other field, you can change it now.\\n  * Feature - reactabular - New `select` module for handling row selections.\\n\\n1.1.5 / 2016-08-04\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - Attach `NODE_ENV` checks to `propTypes`. Smaller size for production usage.\\n\\n1.1.4 / 2016-08-04\\n==================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - sort - Do not crash if column `cell` definition is missing. #178\\n\\n1.1.3 / 2016-08-04\\n==================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - easy - If a header is set both `sortable` and `resizable`, allow custom formatter to used still.\\n\\n1.1.2 / 2016-08-04\\n==================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - sticky - Fix `reactabular-table` import. Missing `* as`.\\n\\n1.1.1 / 2016-08-04\\n==================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - sticky - Fix `reactabular-table` import. It points to the correct package now.\\n  * Feature - table - Drop `lodash/omit` dependency.\\n\\n1.1.0 / 2016-08-03\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - edit - Allow `editingProps` (`value`/`onValue`) to be overridden.\\n  * Feature - table - Added `getRef` for getting references to underlying DOM elements.\\n  * Feature - sticky - Added `getRef` for getting references to underlying DOM elements.\\n  * Feature - sticky - Moved `reactabular-table` as a peer dependency as I realized it's better to let the user decide which version of the table to use.\\n  * Feature - easy - Dropped dependency on react-dom.\\n\\n1.0.11 / 2016-07-29\\n===================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - sort - `sort.reset` accepts object properly now. Earlier it bailed out too early.\\n  * Feature - Add sorting numbers to the header so you know in which order sorting rules are applied.\\n  * Feature - Allow column sorting status to be reset by doubleclicking on a column header.\\n\\n1.0.10 / 2016-07-29\\n===================\\n\\n  * Feature - sort - `sort.sort` accepts `event` parameter now. It defaults to `onClick`.\\n  * Feature - sort - `sort.reset` is a new transform that can be used to remove the given column from the sorting rules.\\n  * Feature - sort - `sort.header` is a new formatter that can be used to apply sorting. This is handy if you use `sort.reset`.\\n\\n1.0.8 / 2016-07-27\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - easy - Make `tableWidth` and `tableHeight` checks looser.\\n\\n1.0.6 / 2016-07-27\\n==================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - easy - Merge column definition `props.className` correctly. Previously it discarded possible value.\\n  * Feature - easy - Add styling hooks. Now you can attach classes to the table structure (table, thead, tbody).\\n  * Feature - easy - Add `onDragColumn` and `onMoveColumns` hooks.\\n\\n1.0.5 / 2016-07-27\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - highlight - Do not pass `undefined` keys to `_highlights` data.\\n  * Feature - easy - Add column visibility to the example.\\n  * Feature - easy - Render `EasyTable` in a fixed viewport.\\n  * Bug fix - easy - Do not re-initialize styles if columns change. Without this CSS resets. I may have to revisit this decision but it seems logical now.\\n  * Feature - easy - Support `draggable` header flag.\\n\\n1.0.3 / 2016-07-27\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - sticky - Make `tableHeader` prop check looser.\\n  * Feature - easy - Resolve nested and `cell.resolve` based data.\\n  * Feature - easy - Support search with highlighting through a `query` prop.\\n\\n1.0.2 / 2016-07-26\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - resizable - New module for resizing columns.\\n  * Feature - sticky - New pair of components (`Sticky.Header`, `Sticky.Body`) that allow you to render data within a fixed viewport.\\n\\n1.0.1 / 2016-07-26\\n==================\\n\\n  * Feature - resolve - Make sure `undefined` keys aren't included in the resolved result.\\n  * Bug fix - highlight - Retain original data while highlighting rows.\\n\\n1.0.0 / 2016-07-25\\n==================\\n\\n  * Complete rewrite. Too many changes to mention. Please study the documentation for details.\\n\\n0.14.2 / 2016-06-13\\n===================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Fix `postinstall` script for Node 0.10. #147 @Gudahtt\\n\\n0.14.1 / 2016-06-11\\n===================\\n\\n  * Bug fix - Use a ref at `input` editor over `this.getDOMNode()` given latter was deprecated in React 15.\\n\\n0.14.0 / 2016-06-09\\n===================\\n\\n  * Breaking - Force `rowKey` to be set.
